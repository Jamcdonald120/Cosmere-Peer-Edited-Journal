\begin{abstract}
A detailed analysis of how useful each plausible combination of Allomantic and Feruchemical powers would be in a modern earth-like society.  We will not be considering Full Feruchemists, Mistborns, Hemalurgy, or any other combination that grants more powers than 1 Allomantic and 1 Feruchemical ability.

\section{\textbf{Introduction}}
The internet is often flooded with the hypothetical question "If you could pick ($n$) abilities from Allomancy and Feruchemy, which would you pick?" (where $n$ is some number generally under 4).  In this paper we analyze all the available abilities from the perspective of a modern Earth-like society with a focus on utility, added value, and entertainment in the hopes of better contextualizing this question in a non fantasy world.  For the purposes of this paper, we will only be considering the question for Twinborns, Mistings, and Ferrings who are not Mistborn nor full Ferruchemists.  We will also be ignoring Hemalurgy, both as a way to gain new abilities, and as a danger to anyone with rare abilities.  Additionally, except in the case of Nicrosil compounders, we will be ignoring Unreleased (but not unkeyed) metalminds.  All other ways of gaining more abilities such as Lerasium, Forgery, or any various Connection/Identity manipulation will similarly be ignored.  We will also not be considering other reasonable combinations that may occur such as a Twinborn Knight Radiant, or with access to Aethers.\n  We will assume that the Invested individual is an average person, and there is a similar ration of Invested individuals to not as found in Mistborn Era 2.\cite{BoM}\n

Any factual information from this paper about the metallic arts can be sourced from our earlier work "A Primer on the Metallic Arts."\cite{primer} Similarly we will be using the proposed standard shorthand recommended in the same.  Additionally, we will use "any* [material]" when referring specifically to any non Aluminum material.  For example "A Coinshot can push any* metal."  The term "drab" will be used anachronistically as shorthand to refer to any human without an invested ability.\n 

Lastly, we will exclude Professional Sports that involve the use of Invested abilities DURING the game by the players, to be covered in another paper dedicated to the design of such sports.\cite{noseball}

\section{\textbf{Analysis}}

\subsection{\textbf{Mistings}}\label{sec:mistings}
	Before Considering pairings, we shall first consider the utility of each variety of Misting individually, assuming no Feruchemical abilities.  For each we will consider the cost of the metal consumed, although we do not know the speed at which a metal burns.  We will consider modern "street" grade metals like one may be able to purchase at a hardware store rather than specific pure preparations that would likely be created if Allomancers did exist in our society.
    \subsubsection{\textbf{Iron}    \includegraphics[height=1em]{images/Iron.png}}\label{sec:mistings:iron}
    Lurcher's ability to pull any* metal gives them nearly unparalleled usefulness in the modern world.  While this ability is less useful (and thus frequently ignored) in combat situations compared to A-St, most individuals do not find themselves in combat frequently.  \\
    
    However, a large proportion of our devices are made of metals.  Consider the phone in your pocket.  It is mostly made of metal, and while it may have an Aluminum casing, most people add an additional phone case to that.  A Lurcher could easily acquire a metallic phone case and would be able to pull their phone to their hand from across the room.
    
    Additionally, a Lurcher should never loose their phone under a pile of clothes.  Naturally this applies to any* metallic object.\n
    
    Also, as A-I creates physical movement, it is absolutely possible to make a Human Input Device (HID) that is operated by "pulling" switches.  This can be as simple as a metal plate in a door to allow remote closing of it, to as advanced as hidden locking devices, full keyboards, or touch screens.\n
    
    While rudimentary flight is possible with A-St, especially in our cable laced planet, we do not recommend it without the appropriate Feruchemical accompaniment as it is likely extremely easy to overshoot an anchor and find ones self dozens of feet in the air without a viable anchor to slow ones fall.  Without the ability to push, resistance of A-P, or any relevant Feruchemical ability such a fall is likely to be fatal.\n
    
    Regrettably most jobs that benefit from A-I would be relatively low paying.  Any manual labor job that requires moving an object between 2 near by points may be made easier by a Lurcher, and they may find work in manufacturing in various roles relating to work piece holding, but "glorified clamp" is not a desirably job description.\n Security organizations will likely seek to hire Lurchers more than drabs as their ability to see and effect metal* objects through clothing could be quite useful in any conflict, however, as Aluminum bypasses this, and is EXTREMELY common in the modern world, Lurchers in such positions would be unreliable and likely only a partial measure.\\
    Lurchers may be able to find slightly higher paying positions as surgeons, but it is likely negligible and likely requires Savant talent levels. \\
    Unfortunately, most jobs a Lurcher would be extremely suited for are already filled by electromagnets and metal detecting devices.
    \n
    
    Iron is extremely cheep coming in at ~\$100 per TON, and it stands to reason no Allomancer would find it difficult to acquire regardless of social status.\n
	\subsubsection{\textbf{Steel}    \includegraphics[height=1em]{images/Steel.png}}\label{sec:mistings:steel}
	Coinshots are very similar to Lurchers and fill many of the same role.  Their ability to Push any* metal grants them the same HID capabilities as a Lurcher, just inverted, but their inability to pull prevents them from being able to quickly grab items.  Detection remains the same, and the job prospects are also likely the same with a few major exceptions.  As Coinshots can push metal* items, they can erect a bullet resistant field around themselves and fire bullet like projectiles without the use of a gun.  This makes them more valuable to a security team than a Lurcher, but not significantly.  The bullet shields are week to Aluminum, and metal jacket technology would likely make Anti-Coinshot bullets as cheep as Full Metal Jacket ones.  Additional, as we already HAVE high power personal projectile launchers (guns) their ability to create such projectiles is of limited in many circumstances. \n
	
	Unlike Lurcher's however, Coinshot's can mostly fly safely.  As they can carry a back up metal object to use as an emergency anchor, the dense network of metal in urban areas would be ideal for a Coinshot.  Likely a coinshot would be able to navigate large cities faster than automobiles. \\This could prove invaluable to an individual.
\n

This also opens up the option of "high speed delivery" as a job, although it likely would not pay well.\n

The ability to fly and be seemingly unarmed also makes Coinshots extremely valuable to military agencies.  We expect all departments of the military would aggressively recruit Coinshots as special forces units.  Coinshots would make excellent assassins and gorilla soldiers.\n

Interestingly, the presence of Coinshots also breaks the question of gun control in a society.  There is no practical way to limit the availability of metal and Allomantic grade steel, and no practical way to control Coinshots.  Thus a portion of the civilian population will ALWAYS have similar capabilities as a drab with a gun.  This issue is only exacerbated by other abilities in the population such as A-P, F-S, and A-Bl.\\\n
Steel is incredibly cheep, while it comes in many alloys we find the most likely Allomantic alloy to be 98\% iron and 2\% carbon.  Prices are more variable than Iron, but are likely around \$1000 per TON, about 10x more expensive than Iron, but still amazingly cheep.\n

	\subsubsection{\textbf{Tin}        \includegraphics[height=1em]{images/Tin.png}}\label{sec:mistings:tin}
	Unfortunately a Tineye's ability to enhance their senses is almost useless in the modern world.  With the exception of taste and smell, we have mechanical devices to enhance the physical abilities far past any Tineye, and we see no entertainment usage of being a Tineye apart from better taste.\n
	
	Thats not to say Tineyes are as employable as drabs, they will still be prized as lookouts in every organization that employs long range lookouts, and as espionage agents.  Unfortunately, a Tineye guard would be unlikely to be paid much more than a drab guard, and espionage agents have a large set of additional skill requirements making it unlikely that being a Tineye will help your cause.
	
	Tineyes may also see employment as drug detection and tracking agents depending on how good the enhanced sense of smell is, but we do not consider replacing a dog a significant career move.
	
	However, there are a few careers which would likely be dominated by Tineyes, mainly quality control taste testers such as those employed by [[XXX ice cream tester man  company]] and perfume companies.  These products rely on subtle molecule combinations in ways that we have not yet been able to mechanically replicate, while at the same time, being unsuited to animal testing.  These jobs are likely EXCLUSIVELY filled by Tineyes or Windwhisper (F-T).  That  being said, these jobs arent common and likely very few Tin users would be able to acquire them.\n
	
	It is tempting to say that visual quality control jobs such as graphic designer, paint mixer, or display calibrators would likewise be filled with Tineyes, however, we find this unlikely as color recognition is a solved problem using technology.\n
	
	Lastly, any Tineye who goes through medical school for surgery is likely to find a well paying job doing high skilled surgery, however, this would still be a difficult career to pursue.\n
	
	Tin is cheep, at [[XXX TIN PRICE]], it also burns quite slowly, so it is likely every Tineye will carry Tin ready to burn at all times.\n
	\subsubsection{\textbf{Pewter}    \includegraphics[height=1em]{images/Pewter.png}}\label{sec:mistings:pewter}
	Thugs would likely be as in demand in the modern world as in Scadrian Societies.  While we do have cranes and other machines to act as mechanical muscles, it is very difficult to out perform the human body in a similar form factor or power consumption even before adding A-P.  Naturally Thugs would be highly employed as... well thugs, buy any organization with security or enforcement personnel including militaries, police, and private security companies.\n
	
	However, due to the benefits Thugs bring, we find it likely that almost every willing Thug will be either in a gang, or employed as celebrity bodyguards.  This would put them solidly in upper middle class in terms of pay.
	
	Similarly special forces agencies would likely attempt to pick up many Thugs.  
	
	Should a Thug be unable to find any other work, there will always be freight and moving companies who want extra muscle.  While we normally dont consider manual labor to be a viable career, a Thug's increased strength and endurance would likely mean they pull 2-3 times the salary of their drab peers.  This makes menial labor more viable as a career.\n
	
	Moving on the entertainment, We dont think there is a person alive who hasnt wished for a momentary boost in strength, dexterity, or speed.  Anyone who enjoys extreme "sports" would benefit from being a Thug.  The healing factor would greatly aid any accidents and the other abilities would reduce them.  While we are generally ignoring professional sport in this paper, we find it likely that Thugs would gravitate towards them as a form of entertainment.
	
	Pewter is cheep, at [[XXX Pewter PRICE]] and it is likely every Thug will carry Pewter ready to burn at all times, however, Pewter does burn extremely fast making it more expensive than it might appear.\n
	\subsubsection{\textbf{Zinc}    \includegraphics[height=1em]{images/Zinc.png}}\label{sec:mistings:zinc}
	Brass and Zinc have highly similar effects.  Zinc Riots emotions, but Brass Smooths them.  While these are opposite, they can be generally used to the same effect.  Both allow their misting to control emotions of another, either by increasing all desired emotions or suppressing all undesired emotions.
	
	It should be noted that this effect is blocked by aluminum and would likely be highly illegal to use publicly.  However, if used Unethically on an unsuspecting target, this can easily be used to manipulate personal relationships including romantic ones.  Thus, if used carefully, Soothers/Rioters could most likely gain advancement in their chosen career faster than another.  However, this is a high risk move as many things will counter the effect and any large scale tampering (of a political party say) would likely be detected by seekers.
	
	While Zinc/Brass are tempting to abuse, using them legitimately is also a viable career.  Any Rioter/Soother could likely find work as a therapist, helping people work through their emotions.  They would also likely be able to find work in soothing/rioting parlors, suppressing negative emotions and rioting pleasant ones.  Additionally, any live entertainment such as acting or dance would likely benefit from a staff rioter/soother working to reinforce the desired emotions in a crowd.
	
	We find it unlikely that there would be any military positions available specifically to rioters/soothers, the effects too minimal to be a benefit in combat.  It is possible that teams of "Routers" would be employed to boost moral among friendly troops and decrease it among enemies, however this is trivial to counter by equipping all soldiers with aluminum lined helmets, effectively negating this.  However it may still be useful in population control in conquered regions.
	
	Covert agencies may wish to employ agents with rioting/soothing, however, they would NEED to be paired with an agent who is a smoker to be remotely viable in field work.  This limits their utility over other misting agents, but does give a slight benefit over drab agents.
	
	[[Price]]
	\subsubsection{\textbf{Brass}    \includegraphics[height=1em]{images/Brass.png}}\label{sec:mistings:brass}
	Soothers and Rioters are almost identical in their abilities, and have been covered together in the section for Zinc \ref{sec:mistings:zink}
	However, they do have a different price, and this section makes the numbers consistent.
	
	[[copy zinc price blurb to brass and change price]]
	\subsubsection{\textbf{Copper}    \includegraphics[height=1em]{images/Copper.png}}\label{sec:mistings:copper}
	Copper is a problematic element in the modern world.  It is almost useless unless people are actively hunting Allomancers.  While it does render the user immune to emotional Allomancy, so does a relatively cheap copper hat.  This makes its personal use almost non extant.
	
	A Smoker would may be able to find a low paying job projecting a coppercloud over a region where someone wishes to disguise Allomantic use, however there are very few areas where that is actually a monetary benefit to the region.  Gang hideouts would likely be the only viable place for such a region.  In most other cases, the permanent occupants would not need to hid their Allomancy, but would likely wish to detect unauthorized use of Allomancy via seekers.  Remember, a Seeker and a Smoker can not effectively work in the same area, as the smoker will render the Seeker blind.  This is problematic because Seekers can protect people withing their detection range from emotional Allomancy by detecting it and physically intervening, but A-C only protects its user.
	
	There would likely be some positions available in covert agencies, as smokers offer the only viable way to use other mistings on field assignments without blowing their cover.  However, smokers have a small range, so any such cloud would have to be limited to 2 party teams.  A likely more useful application would be to have the smokers fill primer cubes to be used by their partnered agent, however we are not considering automatic Fabrials for other Metals, so it seems wrong to do so here.
	
	While there will be individuals who are willing to hire smokers to hide their houses, these will likely not represent a major source of employment.
	
	Lastly, it should be noted that aluminum coated walls would function similar to a coppercloud, but allow detection of Allomancers within the ``room'', further decreasing the employment prospects of smokers.
	
	There will be a few unethical employment options when pared with unethical rioters/soothers to hide their actions.
	[[price]]
	\subsubsection{\textbf{Bronze}    \includegraphics[height=1em]{images/Bronze.png}}\label{sec:mistings:bronze}
	Seekers are massively useful.  While being able to detect other Allomancers is of limited personal utility, we find it likely that ever Seeker who wishes will be able to find a position as a sentry at any government location including embassy, military bases, court rooms, legislatures, prisons, schools, and all residencies.  Seekers are your front line of defense against any Allomantic attack or influence. 
	
	Additionally, all law enforcement agencies will want to keep several seeker to aid in investigating Allomantic crimes, and will most likely seek to make all patrol officers Seekers.
	
	[[price]]
	\subsubsection{\textbf{Duralumin}    \includegraphics[height=1em]{images/Duralumin.png}}\label{sec:mistings:duralumin}
	Regrettably Duralumin offers NO benefit to a misting, and the life of a Duralumin Gnat would likely be identical to that of a drab.  It does have interesting synergies though, so there may be times a Duralimin Gnat would burn.
	\n
	While Duralumin is cheep [[XXX Duralumin PRICE]] it is basically useless, so no price is a good price for its Allomantic consideration.
	\subsubsection{\textbf{Aluminum}    \includegraphics[height=1em]{images/Aluminum.png}}\label{sec:mistings:aluminum}
		Regrettably Aluminum offers NO benefit to a misting, and the life of a Aluminum Gnat would likely be identical to that of a drab.  Unlike Duralumin there isnt even synergies with other abilities.  The only thing an Aluminum gnat has is "The ability to purge unwanted investitures."  It is unclear what those would be in the context of metalborn abilities.  Likely an Aluminum Gnat would never even burn their metal after discovering their abilities.
		
		\n
		While Aluminum is cheep [[XXX ALUMINUM PRICE]] it is basically useless, so no price is a good price for its Allomantic consideration, although it does help neutralize other abilities so this price contributes to the utility of other abilities, mainly copper.

\subsection{\textbf{Ferrings}}
Before Considering pairings, we shall first consider the utility of each variety of Ferrings individually, assuming no Allomantic abilities.  For each we will consider the cost of the metal as a one time investment for the metalminds, although we do not know the capacity of any given volume.  We will consider modern "street" grade metals like one may be able to purchase at a hardware store rather than specific pure preparations that would likely be created if Feruchemists did exist in our society.
Feruchemy is slightly more difficult to analyze than Allomancy as we must account for the downtime to store attribute as well as the time to use the attribute.  This makes many jobs that sound reasonable untenable due to the time required to store attribute.  However, we must also consider the trade in unkeyed metalminds that could provide both additional revenue, or additional charge, depending on the Ferring.  We find it likely that all metalminds will be supplied by designated Compounders, so we will also factor this attribute market value into the value of a Ferring ability.

\subsection{\textbf{Compounders}}
Twinborn will always be at least as useful as their individual Ferring and Misting components, however, Compoundeders take this to the extreme.  Assuming tapping an attribute is even slightly useful, and the metal is cheep enough, a Compounders ability to make an arbitrary amount of attribute at almost no personal cost makes them extremely valuable.  Remember that while we are not considering unsealed metalminds, we are considering unkeyed metalminds.  We find it likely that any such Compounder would easily be able to find employment filling and selling filled metalminds, and any additional career would be by choice rather than necessity.
