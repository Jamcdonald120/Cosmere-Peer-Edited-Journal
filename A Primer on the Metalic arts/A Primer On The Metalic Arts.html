&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XARS">10</a>]</span> Due to the nature of the systems they are interlocked not only with each other, but with all other investiture
systems in the entire Cosmere. As an example of their combined power, a Scadrian (the Lord Ruler) with access to
all 3 became a functionally immortal demigod king with a 1000 year reign.<span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XTFE">27</a>]</span> The only known non vessel, non
splinter, humanoids who have achieved this level of power are Hoid, and possibly Vasher. As such, the basics of these 3
systems are critical to understanding the Cosmere as a whole. Additionally Rosharan fabrial tech appears to use the same
metals,<span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

Roshar.

destroyed in the process and vast amounts of investiture are released. The exact nature of this investiture depends on
the metal its self<span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XTFE-CH7">32</a>]</span> as will be explored in more detail in a later section. A metal can be &#x201C;flared&#x201D; or burned faster
to  produce  a  limited  boost  in  power,  but  there  is  an  upper  limit  to  how  fast  an  individual  can  burn  a  metal.  Each
metal and its alloy are &#x201C;paired&#x201D; and have related effects, one being classified as pushing, and the other as pulling.<span class="cite">

high efficiency metal replacer for any of the base 16 metals. The Allomancer still needs to be able to burn the base metal to replicate
its effect with pure investiture.

creates a &#x201C;metalmind.&#x201D; Later the Feruchemist can withdraw any attributes they have stored within a metalmind to gain a boost to that
attribute. Feruchemy is mostly net neutral. The amount of attribute stored is effectively the amount that can be withdrawn, minus a
slight degradation from inefficiencies. The attribute that can be stored depends on which metal the metalmind is composed of.<span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XTFE-CH22">38</a>]</span> The
Feruchemist can withdraw any amount of stored investiture at any rate. This means given enough time, a Feruchemist can have access
to far more investiture at once than an Allomancer can.<span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XTFE-CH27">42</a>]</span> While a Feruchemist can store and withdraw any amount
of invested attribute at any given time (so long as the reserve is there), there is an optimal rate for both, storing or
withdrawing faster than this rate results in compounding levels of inefficiencies. So while a Feruchemist may be able
to  store  50%  of  an  attribute  to  access  150%  for  a  similar  time,  the  time  the  Feruchemist  could  access  the  reserve
at  200%  would  be  less  than  half  as  long,  despite  the  Feruchemist  drawing  exactly  twice  as  much  of  the  attribute.<span class="cite">

<!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >  While it seems like it should be possible to compound using Hemalurgic powers, it is not as simple as it appears. It is possible, and
Marsh has been doing it,<span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XARS-TLM">13</a>]</span> but there is an &#x201C;identity contamination&#x201D; that is preventing most Hemalurgists from doing so.<span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XTLM-CH28">336</a>]</span> After
her interview with Marsh, Kriss postulates this is a direct effect of the merger of Ruin and Preservation into Harmony causing
Hemalurgy's overall power to weaken in any post Catacendre soul.<span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XARS-TLM">13</a>]</span> However, we disagree with this assessment. In our opinion,
Harmony and Marsh are colluding to prevent Hemalurgic Proliferation, and much of the interview with Kriss is disinformation, possibly
with her cooperation. As this publication has minimal chances of making it back to anyone in the Cosmere its-self, we feel no such
compulsion. It is known that each Feruchemical Hemalurgic spike copies its victims identity for its ability.<span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XHE-Fe-access">198</a>]</span> Thus a regular person
who is made into a Twinborn via Hemalurgy would have 3 conflicting identities, their own, the ferring's, and the misting's. We
postulate that this is the &#x201C;Identity Contamination,&#x201D; and compounding requires that the Allomantic ability of an individual
is able to access the Metalmind, not just the individual. We have 2 potential theories on how this can be bypassed.
<br 
class="newline" />  Our first first theory is that the metalmind to be compounded must be unkeyed or otherwise have its identity manipulated to match
the Allomantic spike. Under this model a way to manipulate Identity is required. The easiest way to acquire this would be a 3rd spike
with Feruchemical Aluminum.<span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XARS">10</a>]</span>
  Our second theory is that the Hemalurgic spikes themselves must be processed, possibly prior to implantation, to remove the inherent
Identity in them so the hemalurgist's Identity is uncontaminated.
Unfortunately, both of these theories are slightly weakened (although not entirely dismissed) by the incontestable fact that Marsh can
compound.<span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

<!--l. 721--><p class="indent" >  A metalmind of a specific metal can be referred to as a [metal]mind, for example a Copper metalmind could be referred to as a

<!--l. 723--><p class="indent" >  When referring to specific metals, a prefix can be used to specify the system. &#x201C;A&#x201D; for Allomantic, &#x201C;F&#x201D; for Feruchemical, &#x201C;H&#x201D; for
Hemalurgic, and &#x201C;T&#x201D; to specify both Allomantic and Feruchemical access. For a Hemalurgic spike, this can be postfixed with
&#x201C;[[attribute]]&#x201D; to specify which attribute is stored within the spike. Additionally, &#x201C;h&#x201D; can be used to specify a power is gained through
Hemalurgy, and &#x201C;u&#x201D; can be used to specify it is gained from an unsealed metalmind. For example a Bloodmaker Slider
using a heating metalmind while pierced with a Steel spike holding Tin Allomancy, could be referred to as a Person
with A-Bendalloy,  F-Gold,  uF-Iron,  uF-Nicrosil,  uF-Electrum,  hA-Tin,  the spike its self would be an H-Steel[Tin]
spike.
<!--l. 725--><p class="indent" >  Terms with the same prefix may be combined, so the same person could also be A-Bendalloy, F-Gold, uF-Iron-Nicrosil-Electrum,

This list is subject to change as new metal names are revealed. So an age compounder could be referred to as a C-<span 
class="msbm-10">&#x1D538;</span>E. For an alloy of
2 God metals, additional notation may be required, such as <sup><span 
class="cmsy-7">&#x2032;</span></sup> to indicate the primary metal, or a subscript to indicate which
alloys, for example a Lerasium Tanavastium alloy that makes a surgebinder could be expressed as <span 
class="msbm-10">&#x1D543;</span><sup><span 
class="cmsy-7">&#x2032;</span></sup><span 
class="msbm-10">&#x1D54A;</span>, or the metal
an Edgedancer's Shardblade is made from could be <span 
class="msbm-10">S&#x2102;</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-7">4</span></sub> or <span 
class="msbm-10">&#x1D54A;&#x2102;</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">ED</span></sub>. Such usage should documented at time of use.
