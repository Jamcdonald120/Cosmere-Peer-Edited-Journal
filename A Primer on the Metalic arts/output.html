<h1 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
<p>Allomancy, Feruchemy, and Hemalurgy all use the same 16 base metals
and some “God Metals” created by shards.<span class="citation"
data-cites="ARS"></span> Due to the nature of the systems they are
interlocked not only with each other, but with all other investiture
systems in the entire Cosmere. As an example of their combined power, a
Scadrian (the Lord Ruler) with access to all 3 became a functionally
immortal demigod king with a 1000 year reign.<span class="citation"
data-cites="TFE"></span> The only known non vessel, non splinter,
humanoids who have achieved this level of power are Hoid, and possibly
Vasher. As such, the basics of these 3 systems are critical to
understanding the Cosmere as a whole. Additionally Rosharan fabrial tech
appears to use the same metals,<span class="citation"
data-cites="RoW-E7"></span> however not all base metals have a known use
in fabrial tech yet, and may be currently undiscovered on Roshar.</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is mostly to consolidate existing knowledge
and to act as a single point of reference for future papers working with
the metallic arts. There is some Limited speculation as well.</p>
<h1 id="the-very-basics"><strong>The very basics</strong></h1>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="allomancy"><strong>Allomancy</strong></h2>
<p>All Allomancers draw power through various metals through a process
called “burning.”<span class="citation" data-cites="TFE-CH7"></span> The
Allomancer ingests a quantity of a specific metal and then can “burn”
the metal to channel power from the shard Preservation.<span
class="citation" data-cites="allo-source"></span> The metal is destroyed
in the process and vast amounts of investiture are released. The exact
nature of this investiture depends on the metal its self<span
class="citation" data-cites="TFE-CH7"></span> as will be explored in
more detail in a later section. A metal can be “flared” or burned faster
to produce a limited boost in power, but there is an upper limit to how
fast an individual can burn a metal. Each metal and its alloy are
“paired” and have related effects, one being classified as pushing, and
the other as pulling.<span class="citation"
data-cites="TFE-CH7"></span></p>
<p>An Allomancer can also fuel their art through a pure investiture
(such as purified Dor). <span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH40"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH64"></span> Such a fuel acts as a virtual high
efficiency metal replacer for any of the base 16 metals. The Allomancer
still needs to be able to burn the base metal to replicate its effect
with pure investiture.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="feruchemy"><strong>Feruchemy</strong></h2>
<p>A Feruchemist can store various attributes in various metals,
temporarily loosing part of that attribute in themselves.<span
class="citation" data-cites="TFE-CH22"></span> This creates a
“metalmind.” Later the Feruchemist can withdraw any attributes they have
stored within a metalmind to gain a boost to that attribute. Feruchemy
is mostly net neutral. The amount of attribute stored is effectively the
amount that can be withdrawn, minus a slight degradation from
inefficiencies. The attribute that can be stored depends on which metal
the metalmind is composed of.<span class="citation"
data-cites="TFE-CH22"></span> The Feruchemist can withdraw any amount of
stored investiture at any rate. This means given enough time, a
Feruchemist can have access to far more investiture at once than an
Allomancer can.<span class="citation" data-cites="TFE-CH27"></span>
While a Feruchemist can store and withdraw any amount of invested
attribute at any given time (so long as the reserve is there), there is
an optimal rate for both, storing or withdrawing faster than this rate
results in compounding levels of inefficiencies. So while a Feruchemist
may be able to store 50% of an attribute to access 150% for a similar
time, the time the Feruchemist could access the reserve at 200% would be
less than half as long, despite the Feruchemist drawing exactly twice as
much of the attribute.<span class="citation"
data-cites="fe-decay"></span></p>
<p>In most cases, a metalmind is identity locked to its creator and can
not be used by another person, however there are 2 special types of
metalminds unsealed, and unkeyed which will be addressed later.<span
class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH3"></span></p>
<p>It is unknown if Feruchemy can use pure investiture or not, and there
are solid arguments both ways.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="hemalurgy"><strong>Hemalurgy</strong></h2>
<p>Hemalurgy is a unique and complicated system and can only be fully
utilized by someone with a mind as vast as a shard.<span
class="citation" data-cites="WoF"></span> Hemalurgy has 3 modes of
operation, the first mode is theft. For theft, a metal spike is driven
into the body of a victim at specific bind point with intent will steal
an ability.<span class="citation" data-cites="WoF"></span> The attribute
stolen depends on the metal,<span class="citation"
data-cites="WoF"></span> bind point,<span class="citation"
data-cites="WoB-holiday"></span> and intent<span class="citation"
data-cites="HE-intent"></span> that used. The resulting attribute
permanently binds it to the spike creating a Hemalurgic spike.<span
class="citation" data-cites="ARS"></span> This process usually kills the
“donor” but does not require death to function,<span class="citation"
data-cites="noDeath"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH47"></span> only that the spike touches blood in a
bind point. The spike will lose investiture any time it is outside of a
body, although it will never completely discharge.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HoA-CH34"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="WoF"></span> This can be mitigated somewhat by storing the
spike in Aluminum<span class="citation"
data-cites="anti-decay-Aluminum"></span> or blood,<span class="citation"
data-cites="anti-decay-blood"></span> but loss of investiture is an
innate part of Hemalurgy.<span class="citation" data-cites="WoF"></span>
Only 1 attribute can be stolen from a person,<span class="citation"
data-cites="HE-only1"></span> and the stolen attribute will always be
weaker than it was in the person.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HoA-CH34"></span> Some metals can extract various
attributes, the exact attribute stolen is dependent on the bind
point<span class="citation" data-cites="WoB-holiday"></span> and
intent<span class="citation" data-cites="HE-intent"></span> used,
however no specific bind point effect is known.</p>
<p>Each metal and bind point has a different effect. The attribute
stolen depends on both the metal and bind point used.<span
class="citation" data-cites="WoF"></span> It is possible for any
investiture system tied to a persons spirit web to be stolen by
Hemalurgy, but the exact metals and bind points are only known for
Feruchemy and Allomancy.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HE-universal"></span> Very little is known about the bind
points and their significance.</p>
<p>It is possibly to charge a spike using multiple victims. Each spike
appears to have a certain charge capacity that it can be charged to, but
can not exceed. So far, only unkeyed investiture has been extracted this
way. There is a way (at least temporarily) to key this ability to
Allomantic or Feruchemical powers.<span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH47"></span> While the exact details of this process
are unknown, we suspect it may involve forging<span class="citation"
data-cites="TES"></span> the spike.</p>
<p>Once a Hemalurgic spike has been created, the 2nd and 3rd mode of
operation are possible. If a Hemalurgic spike is then driven into
another person, that person gains access to the ability stored within
the spike.<span class="citation" data-cites="ARS"></span> Driving this
spike correctly will not kill the person even if the spike is placed in
a normally fatal manner, such as through the heart or brain.<span
class="citation" data-cites="TFE-CH2"></span> Vital organs will
rearrange to accommodate the spike,<span class="citation"
data-cites="WoF"></span> and the spike insertion point can not become
infected.<span class="citation" data-cites="noInfect"></span> Removal of
a spike placed in such a way can kill its bearer.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HoA-CH42"></span> Additionally, an improperly prepared Spike
or an insertion at an incorrect bind point CAN kill.</p>
<p>The 3rd mode of operation is some what more complex. It is possible
to create unique entities with Hemalurgic spikes.<span class="citation"
data-cites="WoF"></span> Only 5* such entity templates are known to
exist, 3 were created by Rashek while holding the power of
Preservation,<span class="citation" data-cites="WoF"></span> and 2
others by Autonomy working through Scadrian agents.<span
class="citation" data-cites="SoS-CH21"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH53"></span></p>
<p>Type 2 and type 3 entities are collectively referred to as
Hemalurgists.<span class="citation" data-cites="hemalurgist"></span></p>
<p>There is an upper limit to how many spikes a single mode 2 or 3
entity may have. This appears to be related to the power of Ruin at the
time of the creation, although this may be misinformation.<span
class="citation" data-cites="ARS-TLM"></span> There is a way to extend
this limit by adding additional spikes that only act to coordinate the
other spikes.<span class="citation" data-cites="TLM-CH15"></span> It is
unknown how far this limit can be extended or what problems arise when
doing so.</p>
<p>Hemalurgy caries inherent risk, each spike placed in an entity
increases its vulnerability to shards and other mental influences.<span
class="citation" data-cites="HE-Shard"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="HoA-CH58"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="HoA-CH13"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="HoA-CH77"></span> For example, even with a single spike Ruin
can speak in your mind.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HoA-CH65"></span> As few as 2 spikes have been shown to
allow a shard to take complete control of an individual,<span
class="citation" data-cites="SoS-CH7"></span> although the lower limit
for a shard controlling a non-construct is 4.<span class="citation"
data-cites="BoM-CH27"></span> It is suggested there is a way to benefit
from Hemalurgy, but transfer these vulnerabilities to another.<span
class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH27"></span> The exact method of doing
so is unknown, most likely it involves manipulating identity or
connection in some way.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="fabrial-tech"><strong>Fabrial
Tech</strong></h2>
<p>Fabrial tech also has a substantial overlap in the metals it
uses.<span class="citation" data-cites="RoW-E7"></span> This paper will
touch on the effects of specific metals within Fabrial tech, but is not
a comprehensive guide to Fabrials and will not address anything else
about their construction or function.</p>
<h1 id="classifications-of-users"><strong>Classifications of
Users</strong></h1>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="allomancy-1"><strong>Allomancy</strong></h2>
<p>A person who can use only 1 base metal is called a Misting.<span
class="citation" data-cites="TFE-CH3"></span> Anyone who can use 2 base
metals on their own can use ALL metals and is called a Mistborn. It is
possible to become Allomancers either by being born one,<span
class="citation" data-cites="TFE-CH3"></span> or by ingesting a bead of
Lerasium.<span class="citation" data-cites="WoA-CH59"></span> Before a
genetic Allomancer can know they have any ability, they must suffer a
near death experience known as snapping.<span class="citation"
data-cites="TFE-CH17"></span> This can be a brutal beating, a bad
illness, or similar. Someone holding Preservation’s power can also make
someone an Allomancer,<span class="citation" data-cites="HoA-EP"></span>
it is unknown if other shards can do this as well. There are different
skill and power levels among Allomancers,<span class="citation"
data-cites="WoA-CH54"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="WoF"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="TFE-CH38"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="TFE-CH31"></span> although generally their power level does
not vary that much, and deteriorates with each generation.<span
class="citation" data-cites="AoL"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="WoF"></span></p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="feruchemy-1"><strong>Feruchemy</strong></h2>
<p>A person who can use 1 base metal is called a Ferring,<span
class="citation" data-cites="Ferring-name"></span> and one who can use 2
base metals can use all base metals and is called a Full Feruchemist
(This is not directly stated, but is inferred from<span class="citation"
data-cites="AoL-CH1"></span> and <span class="citation"
data-cites="TFE-CH3"></span>). The only known way to become a
Feruchemist is to be born one,<span class="citation"
data-cites="TFE-CH22"></span> although another way is said to
exist.<span class="citation" data-cites="other-FE"></span></p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="hemalurgy-1"><strong>Hemalurgy</strong></h2>
<p>Anyone in the Cosmere can theoretically be the victim, user, and
benefactor of Hemalurgy.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HE-hopper"></span> The only restriction is knowledge and
intent. It should be noted at this point that there are certain dangers
involved in having Hemalurgic spikes. Each spike weakens a persons
spirit web. A person with Hemalurgic spikes becomes influenceable by the
shards, powerful Allomancers, and possibly many other entities.<span
class="citation" data-cites="HE-Shard"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="HoA-CH58"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="HoA-CH13"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="HoA-CH77"></span> With a single small Hemalurgic spike and
Ruin can speak in your mind.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HoA-CH65"></span> It is unknown what other shards can do
with a single spike. Additionally each spike degrades the mind and body
in interesting ways.<span class="citation" data-cites="WoF"></span> A
spike can be used as a metalmind and vice versa,<span class="citation"
data-cites="HE-Fe-Mind"></span> but it can not be burned by an
Allomancer.<span class="citation" data-cites="HE-Al-burn"></span> When a
Feruchemist’s ability is transferred via Hemalurgy, access to the
corresponding metalminds also does.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HE-Fe-access"></span></p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="twinborn"><strong>Twinborn</strong></h2>
<p>If a person is both an Allomancer and a Feruchemist, they are called
a Twinborn.<span class="citation" data-cites="AoL-CH1"></span> If a
Twinborn is an Allomancer and a Feruchemist in the same metal, they can
create and fill a metalmind, and then ingest and burn that metalmind.
This releases and multiples the power stored in the metalmind allowing
the Twinborn to then store a greater volume of the attribute in new
metalminds. By repeating this process, an unlimited amount of stored
Feruchemical power is possible.<span class="citation"
data-cites="AoL-CH11"></span> The Twinborn must be able to access the
metalmind Feruchemical to do this.<span class="citation"
data-cites="TFE-CH29"></span> This process is known as ”compounding” as
the stored attribute increases exponentially similar to compound
interest.<span class="citation" data-cites="AoL-CH11"></span></p>
<p>While this is the most obvious synergy between the two investiture
systems, some Silverlight scholars (namely Kriss) believe that each
pairing of metals has access to some unique additional ability similar
to the Resonances exhibited when using Rosharan Surges.<span
class="citation" data-cites="ARS"></span></p>
<p>Each Twinborn combination has a name, but few are relevant. For a
full list of the known Twinborn names, see Appendix A.<span
class="citation" data-cites="MBARPG"></span> If a person is Both a Full
Feruchemist and a Mistborn, they are called a Fullborn.<span
class="citation" data-cites="fullborn"></span> There has only been 1
known Fullborn, the Lord Ruler, he was born a Full Feruchemist<span
class="citation" data-cites="TFE-EP"></span> and used the power of the
Well of Ascension to make himself a Mistborn.<span class="citation"
data-cites="well-mistborn"></span> It is theoretically possible to be
born a Fullborn, but is exceedingly unlikely.<span class="citation"
data-cites="bornfull"></span></p>
<p>While it seems like it should be possible to compound using
Hemalurgic powers, it is not as simple as it appears. It is possible,
and Marsh has been doing it,<span class="citation"
data-cites="ARS-TLM"></span> but there is an ”identity contamination”
that is preventing most Hemalurgists from doing so.<span
class="citation" data-cites="TLM-CH28"></span> After her interview with
Marsh, Kriss postulates this is a direct effect of the merger of Ruin
and Preservation into Harmony causing Hemalurgy’s overall power to
weaken in any post Catacendre soul.<span class="citation"
data-cites="ARS-TLM"></span> However, we disagree with this assessment.
In our opinion, Harmony and Marsh are colluding to prevent Hemalurgic
Proliferation, and much of the interview with Kriss is disinformation,
possibly with her cooperation. As this publication has minimal chances
of making it back to anyone in the Cosmere its-self, we feel no such
compulsion. It is known that each Feruchemical Hemalurgic spike copies
its victims identity for its ability.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HE-Fe-access"></span> Thus a regular person who is made into
a Twinborn via Hemalurgy would have 3 conflicting identities, their own,
the ferring’s, and the misting’s. We postulate that this is the
”Identity Contamination,” and compounding requires that the Allomantic
ability of an individual is able to access the Metalmind, not just the
individual. We have 2 potential theories on how this can be
bypassed.<br />
Our first first theory is that the metalmind to be compounded must be
unkeyed or otherwise have its identity manipulated to match the
Allomantic spike. Under this model a way to manipulate Identity is
required. The easiest way to acquire this would be a 3rd spike with
Feruchemical Aluminum.<span class="citation" data-cites="ARS"></span>
Our second theory is that the Hemalurgic spikes themselves must be
processed, possibly prior to implantation, to remove the inherent
Identity in them so the hemalurgist’s Identity is uncontaminated.
Unfortunately, both of these theories are slightly weakened (although
not entirely dismissed) by the incontestable fact that Marsh can
compound.<span class="citation" data-cites="ARS"></span> To create an
Inquisitor, spikes where typically driven through a victim and directly
into the Inquisitor,<span class="citation" data-cites="HoA-pre"></span>
and very few Feruchemists were known making it odd that Marsh would have
a Feruchemical Aluminum spike. However, he does show some signs of
having one.<span class="citation" data-cites="TLM-2YAD"></span></p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="savantism"><strong>Savantism</strong></h2>
<p>If an Allomancer burns too much of a metal too hot for too long they
can break their spirit web causing irreversible damage to
themselves.<span class="citation" data-cites="WoF"></span> They become
dependent on the metal, but also have heightened ability when using
it.<span class="citation" data-cites="HoA-EP"></span> The Prime
Researcher has confirmed only very few Allomantic savant, and a few
other possible unconfirmed.</p>
<p>Some metals have a more extreme negative side to savantism than
others as noted in the individual metal sections. It is unlikely a
Feruchemist could become a savant without compounding.<span
class="citation" data-cites="miles-savant"></span> Rashek in his 1000
year life likely became a savant in most metals and compounds known at
the time, simply due to raw time.<span class="citation"
data-cites="lr-savant-al"></span> We speculate that the negative effects
of savantism vary based on how rapidly one becomes a savant. The faster,
the more sever the negative effects.</p>
<p>Hemalurgy does not have Savants, rather the more spikes a person
gets, the more insane they go and the easier they are to be controlled
by a shard or Allomancer, its like Savantism, but with none of the
upsides.<span class="citation" data-cites="WoA-CH47"></span> The effects
of Savantism cannot be stolen with Hemalurgy,<span class="citation"
data-cites="savant-no-steal"></span> although a Hemalurgic Allomancer
could become a Savant in the donor ability.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HE-savant"></span></p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="special-metalminds"><strong>Special
Metalminds</strong></h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="unkeyed-metalminds"><strong>Unkeyed
Metalminds</strong></h3>
<p>An unkeyed metalmind is one that can be used by any Ferring with the
ability to use metalminds of that metal.<span class="citation"
data-cites="BoM-CH3"></span> The creation of one is simple, the Ferring
must “blank” their identity and then create another metalmind. This
leads to a metalmind with no identity key. Since identity is an
attribute that can be stored using Feruchemy, it is fairly simple to
create an unkeyed metalmind, so long as the Ferring has a way to store
identity.<span class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH3"></span></p>

commercialization of Investiture for reasons that will be apparent in
the section on Nicrosil. The exact creation method of an unsealed
metalmind isn’t known, but it involves an unknown device called an
“Excisor”, and at least a Nicrosil metalmind.<span class="citation"
data-cites="BoM-CH21"></span> After the “base” unsealed metalmind is
created, additional powers can be added to by someone with that power.
For an unknown reason, adding each additional power is progressively
more difficult than the last, this is likely caused by the souls of the
individuals storing rather than the attributes. Likely a Twinborn would
be able to store both powers with the same amount of ease as just
1,<span class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH21"></span> and a full
Feruchemist or Mistborn could store all 16 attributes without
difficulty.<span class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH28"></span> For some
unknown reason, it is not as simple as creating an unsealed Nicrosil
Feruchemy Nicrosil metalmind and then a set of unkeyed Nicrosil
metalminds each containing one desired attribute (that or no one has
actually tried). To date, no group has managed to create an unsealed
metalmind with more than 3 powers using the hand off method. The Bands
of Morning are an insanely powerful unsealed metalmind that contains all
32 Feruchemical and Allomantic powers.<span class="citation"

but presumably different, Additionally, with current technology, each
individual may only use 1 unsealed metalmind at a time.<span

<p>It is unknown if an unsealed metalmind created by an individual can

Regrettably, nearly everything we know about Unsealed Metalminds comes
3rd hand from an unreliable narrator.<span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH9"></span> Just about all we know for sure is based on

not be known.</p>

<p>An Iron Ferring is called a Skimmer.<span class="citation"
data-cites="ARS"></span> Iron allows a Feruchemist to store their own
mass.<span class="citation" data-cites="ARS"></span> This effect works
directly on the mass its self, not substance or gravity. Effectively, it
directly manipulates the Higgs Field.<span class="citation"
data-cites="higgs"></span> A Skimmer does not change in volume, only
mass. A skimmer can store mass to decrease their terminal velocity,<span
class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH12"></span> or increase mass to
resist an attack.<span class="citation" data-cites="HoA-CH78"></span>
There is an increase in strength with the increase in mass, enough that
a Skimmer can still move normally no matter how much they weigh.<span
class="citation" data-cites="WoA-CH52"></span> Skimmers do not increase
their viscosity with their density, so a Skimmer with a large mass (and
therefore a large density) would be no more bullet resistant than a
Skimmer at regular weight.<span class="citation"
data-cites="gunshot-weak"></span> Skimmers do have conservation of
momentum still.<span class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH12"></span> If a
Skimmer were moving in a frictionless environment then stored weight,
their speed would increase appropriately.</p>
<p>This implies a limit on how fast a Feruchemist can store an
attribute, otherwise a Skimmer could store 100% of their weight. If they
did so while moving, they would instantly accelerate to light speed<span
class="citation" data-cites="Massless"></span> following theory of
Special Relativity<span class="citation" data-cites="spec-rel"></span>
and Conservation of Momentum. Unfortunately, the most obvious solution
“a Feruchemist cannot store 100% of an attribute” breaks down with
Aluminum and the creation of Unkeyed metalminds. There may be some limit
on weight storing that prevents these light speed Skimmers, or it could
be that drag prevents this acceleration, and light speed Skimmers are
entirely possible in a vacuum.</p>

id="compounding"><strong>Compounding</strong></h3>
<p>Compounding Iron is exceptionally dangerous. On the surface it
appears fairly useless since it can only make more mass. However,
gravity uses mass. Consider what would happen if a compounder tapped the
mass of a planet all at once, or even a star. One star worth of
mass<span class="citation" data-cites="solar-mass"></span> in a human
shape is theoretically enough that the compounder would collapse into a
black hole.<span class="citation" data-cites="swartz"></span> It is
unknown if Feruchemy would resist the collapse nor what would happen if
the compounder then stopped tapping mass. Considering the limited
benefits and the potential apocalyptic effects, compounding mass is not
advised.<br />

senses can be useful in deadening unwanted feeling such as when smelling
or tasting something distasteful.<span class="citation"
data-cites="WoA-CH15"></span> A Windwhisperer has to be careful when
tapping a sense to avoid tapping too much as high intensity senses are
still disorienting to them. For example tapping sight causes a zooming
in of vision similar to binoculars,<span class="citation"
data-cites="WoA-CH19"></span> but moving rapidly would then cause nausea
similar to moving rapidly with binoculars.</p>

<p>Tin compounding could be dangerous for the user. Since compounding

retrieve Identity.<span class="citation" data-cites="ARS"></span> The
effects of this are not entirely known, but it has a large number of
ramifications, most notably Metalminds are keyed to Identity. If a
Feruchemist capable of storing multiple attributes (either by being a
Full Feruchemist or by gaining access to a second through a method such
as Hemalurgy), then storing Identity while creating another metalmind at
the same time will result in the second metalmind being created WITHOUT
an Identity lock on it. As such, anyone who can tap that attribute can
use that metalmind.<span class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH3"></span>
It is unknown if the metalmind can be refilled by anyone without keying

<p>The Hemalurgic use of Aluminum is... odd. An Aluminum spike will
remove all investiture based powers from its host.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HE-TB"></span> As an Aluminum bullet does not do this, it
implies the Aluminum spike needs to be made into a Hemalurgic spike by
spiking another person before it becomes active, especially since a
victim is usually killed during the creation of a spike making their
lack of powers rather irrelevant. Such a spike could be used as an
effective (if inhumane) method to restrain a powerful investiture user
(such as a Mistborn, Elantrian, etc) for an extended period. We suspect
the spike only suppresses the powers while it is in place, and that
removing it will restore the powers.<br />

<p>Compounding Nicrosil is one of the most useful things to do, as it

metalmind known, the Bands of Mourning. This unsealed metalmind contains
the ability to use all 16 Feruchemical and Allomantic base metals,<span

Bands also transfer the ability to do. Someone compounding Nicrosil with
the Bands of Mourning could refill or even copy them (assuming they know
how to make an unsealed metalmind). Nicrosil compounding logically leads
to the commodification of investiture. With Nicrosil compounders, access
to an investiture system could be as simple as purchasing an unsealed
metalmind with that system. As Nicrosil compounders are only limited by
the availability of Nicrosil, so too would access to investiture systems
become limited only by Nicrosil.<br />

<p>A Cadmium Misting is called a Pulser.<span class="citation"
data-cites="ARS"></span> Cadmium is an External Pulling Temporal
metal.<span class="citation" data-cites="AL-TB"></span> A Pulser can
create a “slowtime bubble” around them.<span class="citation"
data-cites="ARS"></span> This bubble can be the size of a small
room,<span class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH17"></span><span
class="citation" data-cites="AoL-CH19"></span> and time within the
bubble moves slower than time outside the bubble.<span class="citation"
data-cites="ARS"></span> The compression ratio is enough to let real
hours pass in mere minutes from within the bubble.<span class="citation"
data-cites="AoL-CH19"></span> Once created the bubble is “stationary”
relative to the perceived motion of the Pulser; For example, the bubble
will travel with a train if created on board.<span class="citation"
data-cites="BoM-CH8"></span> The bubble does not move with the Pulser
them-self, just their environment.<span class="citation"
data-cites="BoM-CH17"></span> If the Pulser exits their bubble, the
effect ends.<span class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH17"></span>
Additional, this stationary bubble effect can not be overcome simply by
pulsing the bubble on and off quickly, there is a minimum time between
bubbles.<span class="citation" data-cites="AoL-CH6"></span> There is a
process known as “sculpting” a bubble,<span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH49"></span> but it is not known if this is creating a
bubble with a specific shape, or just a specific size. Given the events
surrounding the detonation onboard the Pewternaut A16,<span
class="citation" data-cites="TLM-CH71"></span> we suspect the former
case.</p>
<p>This time dilation effect bypasses regular relativity; ie an observer
outside of the bubble will perceive light as moving slower within the
bubble.<span class="citation" data-cites="TLM-CH71"></span></p>
<p>The edge of the bubble is of great interest. Fast and lightweight
objects are deflected slightly when entering or exiting.<span
class="citation" data-cites="AoL-CH18"></span> Light is not red/blue
shifted when passing the bubble’s edge.<span class="citation"
data-cites="red-blue"></span> One possible explanation for both of these
effects is that the edge of the bubble acts as a buffer and takes the
average of all light that strikes it over a short time, then replicates
it on the other side of the barrier. This could be used to prevent
red/blue shift but at the same time, light that crosses the bubble will
be delayed slightly from expected. This combined with the transition
between speeds of different parts of a moving object should account for
this. Additionaly, moving objects are “stripped” of the extra energy
they would apparently gain when transition between times i.e. a bullet
fired into a slow time bubble would appear from within the slow time
bubble to move at the same speed as a regular bullet.<span
class="citation" data-cites="bubble-con"></span> Touching the edge of a
bubble is enough to subject an individual to the time effect of the
bubble,<span class="citation" data-cites="TLM-CH49"></span> non sentient
objects appear to act differently.<span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH71"></span></p>
<p>It is also possible that both of these “effects” of time bubbles
where added for narrative convenience (no red/blue shift to prevent
detecting a bubble, deflection to prevent Bendalloy sniper nests, etc)
and are not actual effects.<span class="citation"
data-cites="bubble-con"></span></p>
<p>Using Allomancy targeting something in a area with slower time than
you has a similar effect as Duralumin as the power released into the
area over time is greater.<br />

the exact opposite of Cadmium. Bendalloy creates a “fasttime bubble”
similar to a Cadmium bubble, but where the time inside the bubble is
extended relative to the outside.<span class="citation"
data-cites="ARS"></span> These bubbles are considerably smaller than
Cadmium can create, about 1.5 meters in radius,<span class="citation"
data-cites="AoL-CH18"></span> although the exact radius is hard to

class="citation" data-cites="TLM-CH49"></span> Bendalloy also burns much
faster than Cadmium,<span class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH8"></span>
with 1 easily ingest-able Bendalloy nugget providing only 2 minutes of
burn time. This is further shortened by the burner being IN the fast
time bubble, and such a bubble will only last for about 15 real seconds
before the ingested Bendalloy is consumed.<span class="citation"
data-cites="AoL-CH12"></span></p>
<p>If a Bendalloy bubble is created within a Cadmium bubble the
overlapping region has the average time of the 2 regions. For 2 similar

outside the bubbles. <span class="citation"

<p>As a Bendalloy bubble can move with a large object,<span

class="citation" data-cites="AL-TB"></span> no attribute can be stored

data-cites="SoS-CH2"></span> and has no effect on any mental
Allomancy.<span class="citation" data-cites="silver-no-special"></span>
And it has no known use in Fabrial tech. In context of these 4 arts,
silver does nothing, and has no notable features.<span class="citation"
data-cites="no-silver-al"></span> However, it has been included in this
paper because of some unique interactions.<br />
Aether spores are destroyed by silver.<span class="citation"
data-cites="ToES-CH1"></span> This affect appears to radiate out from
the silver and can destroy spores quite a distance from the Silver its
self.<span class="citation" data-cites="ToES-CH10"></span> This does not
appear to damage the Silver. Silver can also be used to cut Aether
manifestations with ease.<br />
In a similar way, on Threnody, the shades are repelled by silver.<span
class="citation" data-cites="SFSFH-CH3"></span> Touching silver to a
shade hurts it,<span class="citation" data-cites="SFSFH-CH1"></span> and
they can not cross above silver.<span class="citation"
data-cites="SFSFH-CH3"></span> This makes a line of silver the only
known way to keep a shade in or out of an area.<span class="citation"
data-cites="SFSFH-CH1"></span> Silver also heals newly inflicted shade
wounds.<span class="citation" data-cites="SFSFH-CH2"></span> The silver
is corroded by this process and no longer has this effect
afterward.<span class="citation" data-cites="SFSFH-CH1"></span></p>
<p>It is entirely possibly that the “silver” on Threnody is only a
silvery metal such as Aluminum or Steel. Threnodite silver being
Aluminum would explain some of its shade defeating properties, however,
the prime researcher has also suggested it may be possible to use a
dagger of silver to kill a spren, and that an Aluminum dagger would not
work.<span class="citation" data-cites="silver-spren"></span>
Additionaly, we have confirmation from Hoid that Lumar “Silver” IS
Silver<span class="citation" data-cites="ToES-CH4"></span> and not
Aluminum. <span class="citation" data-cites="ToES-CH23"></span> This
makes it sound as if silver may have specific interactions with
cognitive shadows or other denizens of the cognitive realm.</p>
<p>Alternatively, as the Threnodite shades are not definitively linked
to any Shard, and both Spren<span class="citation"
data-cites="ado-spren"></span> and Aethers<span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH42"></span> predate the shattering of Adonalsium. As
Silver affects all 3 in similar ways, it may be part of a far older
investiture system than we have covered.</p>
<p>There is another possible object that uses silver. There are some
chains that originate from Threnody than can be used to “anchor” a user
though a cognitive anomaly (the meaning of which is unclear).<span
class="citation" data-cites="anchor"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="RoW-CH64"></span> These chains are described as “silvery” in
description and may be a method of worldhopping. These may or may not be
connected to the actual metal silver.</p>

<p>The god metals are a particularly tricky topic. These metals are

reason that there would be 16 god metals,<span class="citation"
data-cites="SH-PT3-CH2"></span> HOWEVER, each metal is named after the
Vessel, not the Shard (with a few exceptions), and Sazed created his own
god metal distinct from the existing ones associated with Preservation
and Ruin.<span class="citation"
data-cites="harmonium-existance"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="harm-split"></span> This may mean that each shard can have
multiple metal. To make things worse, there is another composite
shard,<span class="citation" data-cites="arcanum-sel"></span> the Dor,
that has No vessel,<span class="citation" data-cites="WoK-ep22"></span>
but does have a potential god metal.<span class="citation"
data-cites="dorium"></span> Annoyingly this means there is no hard
maximum number of god metals, and no minimum (other than the enumerated
metals). The number of god metals is most likely 18*, but this can not
be confirmed. It is likely that each god metal has at least 1 alloy with
each base metal,<span class="citation" data-cites="shard-alloy"></span>
and 2 with each other god metal.<span class="citation"
data-cites="leras-alloy"></span> This would bring the total number of
usable metals by a full Mistborn to about 900. In general, each god
metal can not be mined,<span class="citation"
data-cites="TFE-CH13"></span> and must be directly manifested by the
shard.<span class="citation" data-cites="RoW-CH84"></span> There is a
way to make a metal without a Shard, but the exact method is
unknown.<span class="citation" data-cites="godmaking"></span></p>
<p>All god metals and their alloys theoretically have an Allomantic,
Feruchemical, and Hemalurgic effect,<span class="citation"
data-cites="FEH+"></span> and probably a use in Fabrial Tech,<span
class="citation" data-cites="godrial"></span> as well as the metals
innate effect.<span class="citation" data-cites="FEH+"></span> Creating
more intrinsically weakens a shard.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HoA"></span><span class="citation" data-cites="WoF"></span>
Burning any of them enough to become a savant would lead to ascending to
holding the shard.<span class="citation" data-cites="godvant"></span>
The exact amount any shard can create is unknown, however Ruin was
severely weakened after a room sized repository was filled with
Atium,<span class="citation" data-cites="HoA-CH81"></span> so shards
generally limit the production.</p>
<p>All god metals are difficult (possibly impossible) to melt.<span
class="citation" data-cites="TLM-CH13"></span> Given that gas and liquid
forms of a shards essence are not noticeably hot, it stands to reason
that god metals do not change phase with temperature.</p>
<p>This property makes some god metals difficult to shape as they do not
necessarily soften when heated and can not be cast.<span
class="citation" data-cites="TLM-CH19"></span></p>
<p>All god metals also have a unique spectrum pattern. When heated the
metal emits light evenly on an impulse function where most frequencies
are the same moderate intensity, but the frequency of the shard is
impossibly high.<span class="citation" data-cites="TLM-CH13"></span></p>
<p>Care needs to be taken when storing god metals. Each is made almost
entirely of pure investiture, and if enough investiture is stored in an
area, a perpendicularity can form,<span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH59"></span> thus large amounts of god metals should
not be stored in a single location.<span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH15"></span><br />
It is likely that a Hemalurgic spike made out of any god metal has the
ancillary effect of connecting the bearer to that shard and facilitating
communication.<span class="citation" data-cites="TLM-CH19"></span> This
may be a base property of the metal, and not related to Hemalurgy, or
this may be unique to Trellium.<br />
As this topic is so nebulous, and shards have no particular grouping, we
will start with the known god metals. Names marked with an * indicate
they where constructed by appending -ium to the Vessel or Shard by the
authors, these names are placeholders only.</p>

class="citation" data-cites="HoA-CH3"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="lerasm-mist"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="WoB-Ler"></span><br />
Lerasium has an unknown Feruchemical and an unknown Allomantic effect
when used by a Mistborn. Likely it makes a Mistborn more powerful. Since
Lerasium is the physical essence of Preservation, and the Scadrian Mists
are also Preservation’s essence,<span class="citation"
data-cites="HoA-CH75"></span> burning Lerasium as a Mistborn may have a
similar effect to burning the mists, i.e. A temporary boost in power,
and a filling of all 16 basic metal reserves.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HoA-CH73"></span><br />
The Hemalurgic use of Lerasium is to steal all abilities from its
target.<span class="citation" data-cites="HE-TB"></span> This does not
include investiture abilities, only innate abilities like strength and
speed.<span class="citation" data-cites="PvAvI"></span><span
class="citation" data-cites="HE-le"></span> Naturally this is considered
a waste of Lerasium compared to its other potential uses.<span
class="citation" data-cites="leras-waste"></span><br />
Lerasium can be alloyed with any base metal.<span class="citation"
data-cites="shard-alloy"></span> Anyone can burn the resulting alloy to
become a Misting in that metal.<span class="citation"
data-cites="lerassting"></span> The other Allomantic, Feruchemical, and

Now the exceptionally irritating part. Lerasium can be alloyed with any
god metal. Anyone can burn the resulting alloy to gain that Shards
investiture system.<span class="citation"
data-cites="leras-alloy"></span> The exact meaning of this is unknown as
not all Shards have innate investiture systems, Ruin for example.
Theoretically this method could be used to become a Sandmaster, create
BioChromatic Breaths, gain the 10 Stormsurges, their Lifelight
counterparts, or the 9 void surges.</p>
<p>From this we can infer that there are at least 2 alloys between god
metals, as all can Alloy with Lerasium to produce the above effect, but
Lerasium isn’t “special” so it follows that there is a second alloy for
each with Lerasium where the Lerasium is secondary.</p>

researcher has confirmed this, there are additional clues to its nature.
Most telling is that exactly 1/16 of those struck with mist sickness got
access to Atium.<span class="citation" data-cites="HoA-CH70"></span> As
there are 16 base metals it would not make sense for these to directly
be Atium Misting as then a base metal would have been left out. If
Aluminum or Duralumin were excluded for being “useless”, the sign of 16
would have broken, as people might have realized that those 2 where
excluded, leading to the belief in 18 metals. However, if this 1/16 had
access to Electrum, it would make sense they would also gain access to
Atium-Electrum.<br />
First we will address Atium its self. Refined Atium theoretically has an
Allomantic and Feruchemical use, but they are currently unknown. Its
Hemalurgic use is to steal any power.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HE-TB"></span> It has a higher efficiency than other
spikes.<span class="citation" data-cites="atium-efficency"></span><br />
There are 2 known Alloys of Atium, the Hemalurgic effect is not known
for either.<br />

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="atium"><strong>Atium*</strong></h3>
<p>Atium* is the default state of Atium as we known it, and is an alloy
of Atium and Electrum.<span class="citation"
data-cites="atium-electrum"></span> In this paper, this alloy is
referred to as Atium* as its real name is unknown, and “Atium” is its
defacto name. The primary Researcher has stated that going forward, pure
Atium will have a different name.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Atium-pu-name"></span></p>
<p>When used in Allomancy Atium* allows the user to see and interpret
the future for a few seconds. This allows its user to become a nearly
unstoppable force.<span class="citation" data-cites="TFE-CH14"></span>
The only limit to this is someone else burning Atium*<span
class="citation" data-cites="TFE-CH13"></span> or Electrum,<span
class="citation" data-cites="HoA-CH3"></span> as they can also see the
same futures and react to them creating a reaction feedback loop. It is
also possible for someone to create 2 equally likely futures and to pick
between them based on the reaction of an Atium* burner.<span
class="citation" data-cites="WoA-CH47"></span> Likely a Spinner could
also counter Atium* by tapping Fortune.<br />
The Feruchemical use of Atium* is to store age.<span class="citation"
data-cites="WoA-ARS"></span> The Lord Ruler used this to become
functionally immortal via Compounding.<span class="citation"
data-cites="AoL-CH11"></span> Extreme caution should be executed when
Compounding Atium*. The amount of age required depends on the real age
of the compounder, so over time the same amount of compounded age will
not stretch as far. Stopping compounding is likely fatal for anyone
extending their life. This may be because they revert to their actual
age instantly, or because they are aging at an advanced rate. Either
way, Atium* compounding withdrawal after 1000 years of compounding
rendered the Lord Ruler helpless (but alive) within seconds of losing
his metalminds.<span class="citation"

<strong>Harmonium (Ettmetal)</strong><span class="citation"

<p>When Sazed took control of Preservation and Ruin<span
class="citation" data-cites="HoA-CH82"></span> to create the combination
shard Harmony,<span class="citation" data-cites="AoL-CH18"></span> he
also created his own god metal, he did not like the sound of Sazedium,
so named it Harmonium.<span class="citation"
data-cites="harmonium-existance"></span> This metal is also called
Ettmetal.<span class="citation" data-cites="harm-ett"></span> Sazeium
might be a better fit, as the metal reacts violently with water<span
class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH22"></span> similar to Cesium.<span
class="citation" data-cites="super-cesium"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="cesium"></span> Unlike most god metals, Harmonium exhibits 2
impulse peaks, Ruin’s and Preservation’s.</p>
<p>Harmonium seems to have been created specifically to NOT be used in
Allomancy or Hemalurgy. It has properties in both,<span class="citation"
data-cites="FEH+"></span> but as it is highly reactive with water,<span
class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH22"></span> it would be difficult to
use in either.<br />
Its direct Feruchemical properties are also unknown.<br />
There is however, a unique property to Harmonium. When investiture is
used near by Harmonium, it is absorbed into the Harmonium and then
radiated outward.<span class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH17"></span>
This can be used to create airships by radiating the effect of a Skimmer
to an entire ship and make it weightless.<span class="citation"
data-cites="BoM-CH21"></span> There may be a distinction between
Allomantic and Feruchemical radiation. Allomantic radiation has shown to
be spherical,<span class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH17"></span>
Feruchemical however seems to be more limited. The Malwish Airships can
become weightless, but the crews still require unsealed Iron
metalminds.<span class="citation" data-cites="BoM-CH21"></span> This
suggests that Feruchemical properties are not radiated in the same way
as Allomantic ones, possibly Feruchemical powers are limited to objects
touching the Harmonium, or possibly only to non sentient objects.</p>
<p>This radiation is highly likely to be controllable with Aluminum,
making it toggle-able or directional.<br />
It is likely that Harmonium is a key component in an unsealed metalmind.
A theoretical way to construct an unsealed metalmind would be to take a
small piece of Harmonium connected to an unkeyed Nicrosil metalmind
charged with the desired ability. If the Harmonium can access the
Nicrosil metalmind on its own (possibly by manipulating connection) it
should be able to radiate it to whoever touches it, thus granting the
ability to the wearer.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the Nicrosil in a unsealed metalmind is
actually an alloy of Nicrosil and Harmonium, and this allows the direct
creation of an Unsealed Nicrosil metalmind.</p>
<p>This may also be the Feruchemical use of Harmonium: Nicrosil, but
unsealed.</p>
<p>The exact method to construct unsealed metalminds is as yet unknown,
and this is pure speculation.</p>
<p>It is possible to split Harmonium into Atium and Lerasium,<span
class="citation" data-cites="TLM-CH71"></span> although this NOT a
typical metallurgical or chemical process, but a nuclear one. <span
class="citation" data-cites="TLM-CH17"></span> The current method is to
heat a bead of Harmonium until it softens slightly, and then pulling it
apart slightly. This causes the Atium and Lerasium to split. If cut at
this point, the 2 parts revert to being 2 blobs of Harmonium.<span
class="citation" data-cites="TLM-CH16"></span> We suspect that using an
Aluminum knife dividing an Aluminum box may have a different effect, but
this has not been tested. The successful method of splitting Harmonium
involves using Trellium as a ”knife”.<span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH16"></span> This results in an explosion that produces
trace amounts of Atium and Lerasium.<span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH17"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH71"></span> On the down side, there is also an
investiture <span class="math inline">→</span> energy conversion. In
this case about 8g of Harmonium yielded 500 kJ energy, even in imperfect
conditions. Once perfected, this could lead to a bomb capable of
unrivaled destructive potential,<span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH71"></span> or a Lerasium manufacturing system.
Harmony claims the Kandra have found a safer way to split Harmonium that
destroys the Lerasium and leaves only Atium,<span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-3WAD"></span> but we suspect he is lying to Kelsier to
prevent Mistborn Proliferation.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="raysium"><strong>Raysium</strong><span
class="citation" data-cites="rayse"></span></h2>
<p>Raysium is the god metal of Odium and has been described as “bright
Golden, almost white” in appearance.<span class="citation"
data-cites="RoW-CH84"></span> Raysium is an interesting metal and acts
as a directional investiture pump. What makes the metal inherently
directional is unknown, but investiture from one end is moved to the
other. So if 2 gemstones are connected with a length of Raysium, it will
force the Stormlight out of one and into the other. This likely works
with all investitures, not just the light based ones.<span
class="citation" data-cites="RoW-CH84"></span> We propose referring to
the end that the investiture is channeled to as the “positive” end, and
the other as the “negative” end for convenience.<br />
Raysium has an interesting use in Fabrial tech. If the gemstone drained
is part of a conjoined fabrial, the conjoinment transfers to the new
gemstone. If the new gemstone is a different size than the original, the
conjoinment acts like a gear ratio based on gem size. So if a
conjoinment is transferred to a gem half the size as the other side, the
new side will move twice as far with half as much force when the first
side is moved.<span class="citation" data-cites="RoW-CH84"></span><br />
Oddly enough, Raysium is another potential candidate to use in the
construction of an unsealed metalmind. It is theoretically possible that
when a metalmind is connected to the negative side of a Raysium spike,
the stored attribute is “injected” into anything (or anyone) touching
the positive side. However, it is highly unlikely (bordering on
impossible) that this is the method currently being used on
Scadrial.</p>

id="trellium-and-bavadinium"><strong>Trellium</strong><span
class="citation" data-cites="trellium"></span> <strong>and
Bavadinium</strong>*</h2>
<p>Trellium is a god metal of Autonomy.<span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH18"></span> It is described as silvery with a red tint
and dark red spots similar to rust.<span class="citation"
data-cites="SoS-EP"></span> This metal is capable of forming Hemalurgic
spikes that can allow a Kandra to use Allomancy or Feruchemy.<span
class="citation" data-cites="SoS-CH7"></span> This Metal is also used to
create single spike Hemalurgic “Zombies” called Chimeras.<span
class="citation" data-cites="SoS-CH21"></span> Additionally a spike of
Trillium in a regular human allows for 1 additional ability WITHOUT
becoming vulnerable to Harmony’s direct control.<span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH4"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH65"></span> This spike also serves to connect its
bearer in a 2 way communication channel to the local Avatar of Autonomy
Trell.<span class="citation" data-cites="TLM-CH19"></span> This likely
can be used to contact Autonomy herself if no local Avatar is
present.<br />
We speculate Trellium may act as a “combination spike” and allow for the
creation of a single spike that grants multiple different abilities.
This could help explain how it can make powerful Hemalurgic creations
with only a single spike, but this explanation is not directly
supported.<br />
It does have a Allomantic and Feruchemical property, but neither are
known. However, its Feruchemical property MAY be to store pain.<span
class="citation" data-cites="TLM-CH34"></span><br />
Trellium is repulsed by Harmonium and Allomancy.<span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH16"></span> This should allow for a passive Allomancy
detector. This can also be used to cause Harmonium to split in a
nuclear-esque reaction.<span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH16"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="TLM-CH71"></span> Only a small amount of Trellium is needed
as a trigger, and it is not consumed.<br />
Due to these unique properties, we suspect that Trellium is not
Autonomies ONLY metal, but rather the one specifically tuned to fight
Harmony. We have no direct evidence for this save the name and the above
highly specific properties.</p>

that Dragonsteel is Adonalsium’s metal. As noted previously, all facts

the abilities of an Elantrian. 1 for power, and 1 for the requisite
connection to Sel to use it.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HE-elantrian"></span> Theoretically spiking a person with a
spike created on Sel for connection would put them in the pool to become
an Elantrian.<span class="citation" data-cites="HE-pool"></span></p>
<p>A spike resists being awakened,<span class="citation"
data-cites="HE-awake"></span> and spikes can be used to steal a Divine
breath.<span class="citation" data-cites="HE-DB"></span> As this breath
is no longer sustaining live, the person who received it would NOT need
a weekly breath.<span class="citation" data-cites="HE-DB-life"></span>
Most likely regular BioChromatic breaths could also be stolen in this
way.<span class="citation" data-cites="PvAvI"></span></p>
<p>The Nahel bond can be stolen with Hemalurgy, but the spren could
still choose to sever it. To effectively steal surge binding, both the
spren and radient would need to be spiked.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HE-Aviar"></span></p>
<p>A dead shardblade can be stolen with a Hemalurgic spike,<span
class="citation" data-cites="HE-blade"></span> but the time to summon it
would increase through Hemalurgic decay.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HE-blade"></span> As the shardblade will manifest if the
bearer is killed anyway, this seems inefficient.</p>
<p>An old magic boon or curse could be stolen with Hemalurgy. It is
possible but difficult to steal just one half of the boon-curse
pair.<span class="citation" data-cites="HE-Old"></span></p>
<p>It is possible to steal singer forms with Hemalurgy. <span
class="citation" data-cites="HE-singer"></span></p>
<p>An Aviar’s Gift can also be stolen, however this is even harder than
a Nahel bond.<span class="citation" data-cites="HE-Aviar"></span></p>
<h1 id="terminology"><strong>Terminology</strong></h1>
<p>It is useful to have standard shorthand when referring to these arts.
As such we propose the following non cannon shorthand.<br />
A metalmind of a specific metal can be referred to as a [metal]mind, for
example a Copper metalmind could be referred to as a Coppermind.<br />
When referring to specific metals, a prefix can be used to specify the
system. “A” for Allomantic, “F” for Feruchemical, “H” for Hemalurgic,
and “T” to specify both Allomantic and Feruchemical access. For a
Hemalurgic spike, this can be postfixed with “[[attribute]]” to specify
which attribute is stored within the spike. Additionally, “h” can be
used to specify a power is gained through Hemalurgy, and “u” can be used
to specify it is gained from an unsealed metalmind. For example a
Bloodmaker Slider using a heating metalmind while pierced with a Steel
spike holding Tin Allomancy, could be referred to as a Person with
A-Bendalloy, F-Gold, uF-Iron, uF-Nicrosil, uF-Electrum, hA-Tin, the
spike its self would be an H-Steel[Tin] spike.</p>
<p>Terms with the same prefix may be combined, so the same person could
also be A-Bendalloy, F-Gold, uF-Iron-Nicrosil-Electrum, hA-Tin. The u
and h are optional unless additional clarity is needed.<br />
A power that has been boosted by Duralumin or Nicrosil and be indicated
with the postfix “+”, so Duralumin Steel push would be A-Steel+.<br />
C can be used as a prefix for compounding, so C-Gold indicates that
Health is being compounded.<br />
The following metal abbreviations based on the periodic table are also
proposed. In cases with multiple acceptable abbreviations, secondary
abbreviations are included in ().<br />

Secondary letters in the abbreviation may be expressed as subscripts if
wished. The previous example can now be expressed as A-Bl, F-G, uF-INE,
hA-T. The spike H-S[T], and the push A-S+.<br />
Should it become necessary, God Metals have also been given
abbreviations. These can be added to the abbreviation of a metal to
indicate an alloy. These should be <strong>Bold</strong> or <span
