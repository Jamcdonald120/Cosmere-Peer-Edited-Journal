tlm changes
wain savant?
everything from ss on usm is unreliable

Trellium hardness 9-10
Trellium brittle

[Trellium bavadinium merge]
Difficult to melt God metals
God metals have a unique spectroscopic frequency.  uniform emmision on all frequencies (white) except for an impulse peak on the shard's color
Trellium is repelled by allomancy & harmonium [generalize? conflict?]

Harmonium radioactive? goes critical (chemical)

Harmonium+trellium=nuclear reaction mass->investiture & Atium/Lerasium (Sazid likely lied to Kelsier)

Seeker detected Feruchemy

compoundinf via hemalurgy is diffixult due to identity contanimation (likely requires unsealed metalminds)

there is a painmaind (possibly any fe can make one)

Concentrated Dor (dorium?) anyfuel investiture replacer

Hemalurgic spikes can be partialy charged and consume multiple people

Hemalurgic spikes can contain unkeyed potential

There is a way to key this to an allomantic power

bendlaloy small, but touchign it counts

new construct

Iron eyes see without iron, spirit sight, shows atoms and compositions

add Kelsier as psudo construct, a soul pinned to bones by a single spikes, allowing him to act in a limited way

There is a limit to how fast Durlimin can boost, but it is MASSIVE (Spook managed several seconds of duralimin speed with BAGS of Bendalloy)
