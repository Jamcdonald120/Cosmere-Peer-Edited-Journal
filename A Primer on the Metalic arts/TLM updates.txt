tlm changes

Allomancy 
Concentrated Dor (dorium?) anyfuel investiture replacer \cite{TLM-CH40}\cite{TLM-CH64}

Feruchemy
there is a painmind (possibly any fe can make one)
(add note to copper, gold, and tin)\cite{TLM-CH34}

unsealed metalmind
everything from ss on usm is unreliable\cite{TLM-CH9}

Preservation 
Preservation hemalurgy hear WRONG, preservation can hear any scadrian all the time

Hemalurgy
compoundinf via hemalurgy is diffixult due to identity contanimation (likely requires unsealed metalminds)\cite{TLM-CH28}
Hemalurgic spikes can be partialy charged and consume multiple people\cite{TLM-CH47}
Hemalurgic spikes can contain unkeyed potential \cite{TLM-CH47}
There is a way to key this to an allomantic power (possibly soul stamping)\cite{TLM-CH47}\cite{TES} (The Emperors Soul)
Hemalurgy nerfs\cite{ARS-TLM}
Hemalurgy Cordination\cite{TLM-CH15}

tin note feruchemy \cite{TLM-CH34}

seeker
[TLM-ch35] Seeker detected Feruchemy\cite{TLM-CH25}

copper note feruchemy\cite{TLM-CH34}

gold note eferucmey\cite{TLM-CH34}

Aluminum/Cadmium 
slow leach (find wob)\cite{slow-leech}https://wob.coppermind.net/events/101-conquest-46/#e881

Duralimin
There is a limit to how fast Durlimin can boost, but it is MASSIVE (Wayne managed several seconds of duralimin speed with BAGS of Bendalloy)

Cadmium
bendlaloy small, but touchign it counts\cite{TLM-CH49}
time dilation relativity bypass confirm\cite{TLM-CH71}

bendalloy
wain savant? \cite{TLM-CH8}\cite{TLM-CH49}\cite{TLM-CH71}
bubble scuplting\cite{TLM-CH49}
F-Be does not go to bathroom when accessing stores\cite{bathroom} https://wob.coppermind.net/events/508-dragonsteel-2022/

Steel Inquisitor
Iron eyes see without iron, spirit sight, shows atoms and compositions

new construct (metal mutant) Chimera with 2 spikes\cite{TLM-CH53}\cite{TLM-CH56}

Add Kelsier \cite{TFE-CH34}
add Kelsier as psudo construct, a soul pinned to bones by a single spikes, allowing him to act in a limited way


God Metals in general
Difficult to melt God metals\cite{TLM-CH13}
God metals have a unique spectroscopic frequency.  uniform emmision on all frequencies (white) except for an impulse peak on the shard's color\cite{TLM-CH13}
Enough investiture in 1 place causes perpendicularity\cite{TLM-CH15}

Harmonium 
Harmonium+trellium=nuclear reaction mass->investiture & Atium/Lerasium (Sazid likely lied to Kelsier)
\cite{TLM-CH71}
\cite{TLM-CH17}
\cite{TLM-CH16}
\cite{TLM-3WAD}

Trellium radio \cite{TLM-CH19}
Trellium \cite{TLM-CH19}
Trellium hardness 9-10
Trellium brittle
[Trellium bavadinium merge][leave possiblity for other bavadinium]\cite{TLM-CH18}
Trellium is repelled by allomancy & harmonium [generalize? conflict?]
Trellium spike helps prevent Harmony controll
Trellium pain note\cite{TLM-CH34}
\cite{TLM-CH4}\cite{TLM-CH65}
(dorium?) anyfuel investiture replacer\cite{TLM-CH40}\cite{TLM-CH64}
\cite{SH-PT3-CH3}
