Abstract—In the Cosmere there are 3 interlocked investiture
systems Hemalurgy, Feruchemy, and Allomancy. These systems
have such a large influence on the Cosmere as a whole that they
can not go ignored despite being mostly confined to Scadrial.
Additionally Rosharan fabrial technology appears to use the same
metals, further increasing influence.

I. INTRODUCTION
Allomancy, Feruchemy, and Hemalurgy all use the same
16 base metals and some "God Metals" created by shards.[10] Due to the nature of the systems they are interlocked not
only with each other, but with all other investiture systems in
the entire Cosmere. As an example of their combined power,
a Scadrian (the Lord Ruler) with access to all 3 became a
functionally immortal demigod king with a 1000 year reign.[25] The only known non vessel, non splinter, humanoids
who have achieved this level of power are Hoid, and possibly
Vasher. As such, the basics of these 3 systems are critical to
understanding the Cosmere as a whole. Additionally Rosharan
fabrial tech appears to use the same metals,[306] however not
all base metals have a known use in fabrial tech yet, and may
be currently undiscovered on Roshar.
The purpose of this paper is mostly to consolidate existing
knowledge and to act as a single point of reference for future
papers working with the metallic arts. There is some Limited
speculation as well.
II. THE VERY BASICS
Allomancy
All Allomancers draw power through various metals
through a process called "burning."[30] The Allomancer
ingests a quantity of a specific metal and then can "burn"
the metal to channel power from the shard Preservation.[109]
The metal is destroyed in the process and vast amounts of
investiture are released. The exact nature of this investiture
depends on the metal its self[30] as will be explored in more
detail in a later section. A metal can be "flared" or burned
faster to produce a limited boost in power, but there is an
upper limit to how fast an individual can burn a metal. Each
metal and its alloy are "paired" and have related effects, one
being classified as pushing, and the other as pulling.[30]
An Allomancer can also fuel their art through a pure
investiture (such as purified Dor).[335][343] Such a fuel
acts as a virtual high efficiency metal replacer for any of the
base 16 metals. The Allomancer still needs to be able to burn
the base metal to replicate its effect with pure investiture.
Feruchemy
A Feruchemist can store various attributes in various metals,
temporarily loosing part of that attribute in themselves.[36]
This creates a "metalmind." Later the Feruchemist can withdraw any attributes they have stored within a metalmind to gain
a boost to that attribute. Feruchemy is mostly net neutral. The
amount of attribute stored is effectively the amount that can
be withdrawn, minus a slight degradation from inefficiencies.
The attribute that can be stored depends on which metal
the metalmind is composed of.[36] The Feruchemist can
withdraw any amount of stored investiture at any rate. This
means given enough time, a Feruchemist can have access to far
more investiture at once than an Allomancer can.[40] While
a Feruchemist can store and withdraw any amount of invested
attribute at any given time (so long as the reserve is there),
there is an optimal rate for both, storing or withdrawing faster
than this rate results in compounding levels of inefficiencies.
So while a Feruchemist may be able to store 50% of an
attribute to access 150% for a similar time, the time the
Feruchemist could access the reserve at 200% would be less
than half as long, despite the Feruchemist drawing exactly
twice as much of the attribute.[105]
In most cases, a metalmind is identity locked to its creator
and can not be used by another person, however there are 2
special types of metalminds unsealed, and unkeyed which will
be addressed later.[205]
It is unknown if Feruchemy can use pure investiture or not,
and there are solid arguments both ways.

Hemalurgy
Hemalurgy is a unique and complicated system and can only
be fully utilized by someone with a mind as vast as a shard.[352] Hemalurgy has 3 modes of operation, the first mode is
theft. For theft, a metal spike is driven into the body of a victim
at specific bind point with intent will steal an ability.[352] The
attribute stolen depends on the metal,[352] bind point,[175]
and intent[274] that used. The resulting attribute permanently
binds it to the spike creating a Hemalurgic spike.[10] This
process usually kills the "donor" but does not require death to
function,[132][337] only that the spike touches blood in a
bind point. The spike will lose investiture any time it is outside
of a body, although it will never completely discharge.[80][352] This can be mitigated somewhat by storing the spike in
Aluminum[243] or blood,[318] but loss of investiture is an
innate part of Hemalurgy.[352] Only 1 attribute can be stolen
from a person,[264] and the stolen attribute will always be
weaker than it was in the person.[80] Some metals can extract
various attributes, the exact attribute stolen is dependent on the
bind point[175] and intent[274] used, however no specific
bind point effect is known.
Each metal and bind point has a different effect. The
attribute stolen depends on both the metal and bind point
used.[352] It is possible for any investiture system tied to
a persons spirit web to be stolen by Hemalurgy, but the exact
metals and bind points are only known for Feruchemy and
Allomancy.[141] Very little is known about the bind points
and their significance.
It is possibly to charge a spike using multiple victims.
Each spike appears to have a certain charge capacity that it
can be charged to, but can not exceed. So far, only unkeyed
investiture has been extracted this way. There is a way (at least
temporarily) to key this ability to Allomantic or Feruchemical
powers.[337] While the exact details of this process are
unknown, we suspect it may involve forging[142] the spike.
Once a Hemalurgic spike has been created, the 2nd and
3rd mode of operation are possible. If a Hemalurgic spike
is then driven into another person, that person gains access
to the ability stored within the spike.[10] Driving this spike
correctly will not kill the person even if the spike is placed in
a normally fatal manner, such as through the heart or brain.[26] Vital organs will rearrange to accommodate the spike,[352] and the spike insertion point can not become infected.[255] Removal of a spike placed in such a way can kill its
bearer.[84] Additionally, an improperly prepared Spike or an
insertion at an incorrect bind point CAN kill.
The 3rd mode of operation is some what more complex. It
is possible to create unique entities with Hemalurgic spikes.[352] Only 5* such entity templates are known to exist, 3 were
created by Rashek while holding the power of Preservation,[352] and 2 others by Autonomy working through Scadrian
agents.[183][339]
Type 2 and type 3 entities are collectively referred to as
Hemalurgists.[108]
There is an upper limit to how many spikes a single mode
2 or 3 entity may have. This appears to be related to the
power of Ruin at the time of the creation, although this may
be misinformation.[13] There is a way to extend this limit by
adding additional spikes that only act to coordinate the other
spikes.[327] It is unknown how far this limit can be extended
or what problems arise when doing so.
Hemalurgy caries inherent risk, each spike placed in an
entity increases its vulnerability to shards and other mental
influences.[189][86][74][95] For example, even with a
single spike Ruin can speak in your mind.[88] As few as
2 spikes have been shown to allow a shard to take complete
control of an individual,[182] although the lower limit for a
shard controlling a non-construct is 4.[213] It is suggested
there is a way to benefit from Hemalurgy, but transfer these
vulnerabilities to another.[213] The exact method of doing so
is unknown, most likely it involves manipulating identity or
connection in some way.
Fabrial Tech
Fabrial tech also has a substantial overlap in the metals it
uses.[306] This paper will touch on the effects of specific
metals within Fabrial tech, but is not a comprehensive guide
to Fabrials and will not address anything else about their
construction or function.
III. CLASSIFICATIONS OF USERS
Allomancy
A person who can use only 1 base metal is called a Misting.[27] Anyone who can use 2 base metals on their own can use
ALL metals and is called a Mistborn. It is possible to become
Allomancers either by being born one,[27] or by ingesting a
bead of Lerasium.[66] Before a genetic Allomancer can know
they have any ability, they must suffer a near death experience
known as snapping.[34] This can be a brutal beating, a bad
illness, or similar. Someone holding Preservation's power can
also make someone an Allomancer,[99] it is unknown if
other shards can do this as well. There are different skill
and power levels among Allomancers,[64][352][47][42]
although generally their power level does not vary that much,
and deteriorates with each generation.[118][352]
Feruchemy
A person who can use 1 base metal is called a Ferring,[114] and one who can use 2 base metals can use all base
metals and is called a Full Feruchemist (This is not directly
stated, but is inferred from[119] and[27]). The only known
way to become a Feruchemist is to be born one,[36] although
another way is said to exist.[289]
Hemalurgy
Anyone in the Cosmere can theoretically be the victim,
user, and benefactor of Hemalurgy.[113] The only restriction
is knowledge and intent. It should be noted at this point
that there are certain dangers involved in having Hemalurgic
spikes. Each spike weakens a persons spirit web. A person
with Hemalurgic spikes becomes influenceable by the shards,
<<PAGE>>
powerful Allomancers, and possibly many other entities.[189][86][74][95] With a single small Hemalurgic spike and Ruin
can speak in your mind.[88] It is unknown what other shards
can do with a single spike. Additionally each spike degrades
the mind and body in interesting ways.[352] A spike can be
used as a metalmind and vice versa,[135] but it can not be
burned by an Allomancer.[110] When a Feruchemist's ability
is transferred via Hemalurgy, access to the corresponding
metalminds also does.[196]
Twinborn
If a person is both an Allomancer and a Feruchemist, they
are called a Twinborn.[119] If a Twinborn is an Allomancer
and a Feruchemist in the same metal, they can create and
fill a metalmind, and then ingest and burn that metalmind.
This releases and multiples the power stored in the metalmind
allowing the Twinborn to then store a greater volume of the
attribute in new metalminds. By repeating this process, an
unlimited amount of stored Feruchemical power is possible.[123] The Twinborn must be able to access the metalmind
Feruchemical to do this.[41] This process is known as
"compounding" as the stored attribute increases exponentially
similar to compound interest.[123]
While this is the most obvious synergy between the two
investiture systems, some Silverlight scholars (namely Kriss)
believe that each pairing of metals has access to some unique
additional ability similar to the Resonances exhibited when
using Rosharan Surges.[10]
Each Twinborn combination has a name, but few are
relevant. For a full list of the known Twinborn names, see
Appendix A.[153] If a person is Both a Full Feruchemist and
a Mistborn, they are called a Fullborn.[223] There has only
been 1 known Fullborn, the Lord Ruler, he was born a Full
Feruchemist[48] and used the power of the Well of Ascension
to make himself a Mistborn.[224] It is theoretically possible
to be born a Fullborn, but is exceedingly unlikely.[176]
While it seems like it should be possible to compound using
Hemalurgic powers, it is not as simple as it appears. It is
possible, and Marsh has been doing it,[13] but there is an
"identity contamination" that is preventing most Hemalurgists
from doing so.[333] After her interview with Marsh, Kriss
postulates this is a direct effect of the merger of Ruin and
Preservation into Harmony causing Hemalurgy's overall power
to weaken in any post Catacendre soul.[13] However, we
disagree with this assessment. In our opinion, Harmony and
Marsh are colluding to prevent Hemalurgic Proliferation, and
much of the interview with Kriss is disinformation, possibly
with her cooperation. As this publication has minimal chances
of making it back to anyone in the Cosmere its-self, we
feel no such compulsion. It is known that each Feruchemical
Hemalurgic spike copies its victims identity for its ability.[196] Thus a regular person who is made into a Twinborn
via Hemalurgy would have 3 conflicting identities, their own,
the ferring's, and the misting's. We postulate that this is
the "Identity Contamination," and compounding requires that
the Allomantic ability of an individual is able to access
the Metalmind, not just the individual. We have 2 potential
theories on how this can be bypassed.
Our first first theory is that the metalmind to be compounded
must be unkeyed or otherwise have its identity manipulated
to match the Allomantic spike. Under this model a way to
manipulate Identity is required. The easiest way to acquire
this would be a 3rd spike with Feruchemical Aluminum.[10]
Our second theory is that the Hemalurgic spikes themselves
must be processed, possibly prior to implantation, to remove
the inherent Identity in them so the hemalurgist's Identity is
uncontaminated.
Unfortunately, both of these theories are slightly weakened
(although not entirely dismissed) by the incontestable fact
that Marsh can compound.[10] To create an Inquisitor, spikes
where typically driven through a victim and directly into the
Inquisitor,[100] and very few Feruchemists were known making it odd that Marsh would have a Feruchemical Aluminum
spike. However, he does show some signs of having one.[347]
Savantism
If an Allomancer burns too much of a metal too hot for
too long they can break their spirit web causing irreversible
damage to themselves.[352] They become dependent on the
metal, but also have heightened ability when using it.[99] The
Prime Researcher has confirmed only very few Allomantic
savant, and a few other possible unconfirmed.
Some metals have a more extreme negative side to savantism
than others as noted in the individual metal sections. It is
unlikely a Feruchemist could become a savant without compounding.[293] Rashek in his 1000 year life likely became
a savant in most metals and compounds known at the time,
simply due to raw time.[145] We speculate that the negative
effects of savantism vary based on how rapidly one becomes
a savant. The faster, the more sever the negative effects.
Hemalurgy does not have Savants, rather the more spikes a
person gets, the more insane they go and the easier they are
to be controlled by a shard or Allomancer, its like Savantism,
but with none of the upsides.[61] The effects of Savantism
cannot be stolen with Hemalurgy,[190] although a Hemalurgic
Allomancer could become a Savant in the donor ability.[270]
Special Metalminds
Unkeyed Metalminds:
An unkeyed metalmind is one that can be used by any
Ferring with the ability to use metalminds of that metal.[205]
The creation of one is simple, the Ferring must "blank" their
identity and then create another metalmind. This leads to a
metalmind with no identity key. Since identity is an attribute
that can be stored using Feruchemy, it is fairly simple to create
an unkeyed metalmind, so long as the Ferring has a way to
store identity.[205]
<<PAGE>>
Unsealed Metalminds:
An unsealed metalmind is one that can be used by ANYONE regardless of if they are a Feruchemist or not.[227]
These have unrivaled potential for the commercialization of
Investiture for reasons that will be apparent in the section on
Nicrosil. The exact creation method of an unsealed metalmind
isn't known, but it involves an unknown device called an
"Excisor", and at least a Nicrosil metalmind.[210] After the
"base" unsealed metalmind is created, additional powers can
be added to by someone with that power. For an unknown
reason, adding each additional power is progressively more
difficult than the last, this is likely caused by the souls of the
individuals storing rather than the attributes. Likely a Twinborn
would be able to store both powers with the same amount
of ease as just 1,[210] and a full Feruchemist or Mistborn
could store all 16 attributes without difficulty.[214] For some
unknown reason, it is not as simple as creating an unsealed
Nicrosil Feruchemy Nicrosil metalmind and then a set of
unkeyed Nicrosil metalminds each containing one desired
attribute (that or no one has actually tried). To date, no group
has managed to create an unsealed metalmind with more than
3 powers using the hand off method. The Bands of Morning
are an insanely powerful unsealed metalmind that contains all
32 Feruchemical and Allomantic powers.[214] The Bands
where created using an unknown, but presumably different,
Additionally, with current technology, each individual may
only use 1 unsealed metalmind at a time.[210]
It is unknown if an unsealed metalmind created by an
individual can also keyed. All sample unsealed metalminds
we have are also unkeyed.
Regrettably, nearly everything we know about Unsealed
Metalminds comes 3rd hand from an unreliable narrator.[325] Just about all we know for sure is based on the Malwish
Medalions and the Bands of Morning. The Malwish regard
unsealed metalminds as a controlled technology, and even
within their own culture the exact limitations and methods of
current technology may not be known.
Painmind:
Telsin insinuates that there is a way to store pain in a
metalmind.[334] This may have been a lie, if not, we do
not know which metal is required. This may be a general
Feruchemical ability, or it may be related to Tin, Copper,
Gold, or Trellium.
IV. THE BASE METALS
There are 16 base metals.[352] 8 Of the base metals
are pure elements, and 8 are alloys of those.[30] We are
reasonably sure there ARE only 16 base metals, but this
assumption may be wrong or in some way limited.[90][156]
The metals are arranged in 4 groups of 4.[354] The exact
labels of the groups varies between system,[355][356] and
within Allomancy they are also grouped in to 2 additional
sub groups (push/pull and internal/external),[10] but the same
metals are always in the same group between systems.[355][356] Each alloy is in the same group as its base metal,[354]
except all bases are "pulling" and all alloys are "pushing"[10](Table I). These metals are used in other systems as well.
These usages will be noted on a per metal basis.

Iron
<<PAGE>>
Allomancy: An Iron Misting is called a Lurcher.[10] Iron
is an External Pulling Physical metal.[354] Burning Iron
allows an Allomancer to pull on any metal[10] other than
Aluminum.[204] The pull has to be directly towards the
"center of self"[292] of the Allomancer but can originate
from any point on the metal object.[44] There is a theoretical
way to pull non metallic objects, but it is currently unknown.[314][214] This force acts both on the object and the Lurcher.
If the Lurcher pulls on a light object it will move towards
them, if they pull a heavy or well anchored object, they move
towards it.[30] It is possible but difficult to pull lightly on an
object.[30][54] Because of this, objects generally fly towards
the Lurcher rather than dragging on the ground. A person
burning Iron can sense all the viable targets to be pushed
around them.[30] Metal within a person is harder to pull,[30]
virtually (but not actually) impossible.[47][93] As is highly
invested metal, such as a metalmind.[182] The greater the
amount of investiture within an object or person, the harder.[158] An extremely powerful Lurcher can pull on elemental
metal in materials that are not traditionally "metallic",[214]
it is not known if this is the same mechanism that allows for
the pulling of truly non metallic objects, or if the pull actually
effects microscopic metal particles present in the object.[314]
It is hinted that a Lurcher can "see" and presumably "pull"
"souls."[214] It is unknown the effect this would have.
Feruchemy: An Iron Ferring is called a Skimmer.[10]
Iron allows a Feruchemist to store their own mass.[10] This
effect works directly on the mass its self, not substance or
gravity. Effectively, it directly manipulates the Higgs Field.[216] A Skimmer does not change in volume, only mass. A
skimmer can store mass to decrease their terminal velocity,[208] or increase mass to resist an attack.[96] There is an
increase in strength with the increase in mass, enough that
a Skimmer can still move normally no matter how much
they weigh.[62] Skimmers do not increase their viscosity
with their density, so a Skimmer with a large mass (and
therefore a large density) would be no more bullet resistant
than a Skimmer at regular weight.[159] Skimmers do have
conservation of momentum still.[208] If a Skimmer were
moving in a frictionless environment then stored weight, their
speed would increase appropriately.
This implies a limit on how fast a Feruchemist can store
an attribute, otherwise a Skimmer could store 100% of their
weight. If they did so while moving, they would instantly
accelerate to light speed[24] following theory of Special
Relativity[3] and Conservation of Momentum. Unfortunately,
the most obvious solution "a Feruchemist cannot store 100%
of an attribute" breaks down with Aluminum and the creation
of Unkeyed metalminds. There may be some limit on weight
storing that prevents these light speed Skimmers, or it could be
that drag prevents this acceleration, and light speed Skimmers
are entirely possible in a vacuum.
Compounding: Compounding Iron is exceptionally
dangerous. On the surface it appears fairly useless since
it can only make more mass. However, gravity uses mass.
Consider what would happen if a compounder tapped the
mass of a planet all at once, or even a star. One star worth
of mass[1] in a human shape is theoretically enough that
the compounder would collapse into a black hole.[353] It is
unknown if Feruchemy would resist the collapse nor what
would happen if the compounder then stopped tapping mass.
Considering the limited benefits and the potential apocalyptic
effects, compounding mass is not advised.
Savantism: The effect of Iron savantism is unknown, but
it is likely related the amount of control or power a Lurcher
has, or possibly Steel inquisitor-like blindsight.[45] As Iron
is an external power, the down sides of savantism are likely
less extreme than the internal powers.
Hemalurgy: A Hemalurgic spike made from Iron steals
the physical strength of a person.[356]
Fabrial: In Fabrial Tech, an Iron cage will attract the
element of the trapped spren.[310][167]
Aethers: Aethers to grow towards nearby Iron.[19]
Steel
Allomancy: A Steel Misting is called a Coinshot.[10]
Steel is a External Pushing Physical metal.[354] Steel is
Allomanticaly identical to Iron, except instead of pulling, it
pushes.[10]
Feruchemy: A Steel Ferring is called a Steelrunner. Steel
stores physical speed, and allows for an extremely fast sprint.[10] Tapping Steel automatically grants the G resistance to
the inherent accelerations,[233] but not resistance.[146]
Compounding: A Steel compounder would have access to
near infinite speed, and while they can not use this to run
FTL,[152] anything less than that is possible. Care should
be taken when compounding Steel so as not to run too fast
in atmosphere.[146]
Savantism: Steel savantism is unknown, but is likely
similar to Iron savantism. It is possible that Wax is a low
level Steel savant and his bullet deflecting bubble is related
to savantism.[131][160] It is also possible Zane is a Steel
Savant.[54]
Hemalurgy: A Hemalurgic spike made from Steel steals
Physical Allomantic powers.[356]
Fabrial: In Fabrial Tech, a Steel cage functions like an
Iron cage, but it repels instead of attracts.[310]
Aethers: Aethers to grow away from nearby Steel.[19]
<<PAGE>>
Tin
Allomancy: A Tin Misting is called a Tineye.[10] Tin is
an Internal Pulling Physical metal. Burning Tin enhances all
the external senses of a person.[354] These senses included
touch, temperature, sight, hearing, smell, taste, and pain.[10]
A Tineye can detect stimuli that a regular person could not.
This includes the taste of poisons,[55] feeling minute details,
and seeing stars on an overcast night.[30] This is also the
weakness of a Tineye, burning Tin does not increase sensation
tolerance, thus if a Tineye looks at a bright flash of light
while burning Tin,[30] they are more affected than someone
not burning Tin would be. This is exacerbated by the fact a
Tineye can not choose which senses are heightened,[43] it is
an all or nothing situation. Burning Tin also allows a Tineye
to ignore the Scadrian mists[30] (the essence of Preservation[94]). Tineyes can not enhance their internal senses such as
proprioception, balance, or chronoception.[83]
Feruchemy: A Tin Ferring is known as a Windwhisperer.[10] Feruchemical Tin stores the same physical senses as
Allomantic Tin. Each Tin metalmind can only be used for one
sense at a time.[10] Storing senses can be useful in deadening
unwanted feeling such as when smelling or tasting something
distasteful.[53] A Windwhisperer has to be careful when
tapping a sense to avoid tapping too much as high intensity
senses are still disorienting to them. For example tapping sight
causes a zooming in of vision similar to binoculars,[56] but
moving rapidly would then cause nausea similar to moving
rapidly with binoculars.
It may be possible that Tin can store internal senses such
as Pain. This is one possible explanation of a Painmind.[334]
Compounding: Tin compounding could be dangerous for
the user. Since compounding would create more of a sense,
and tapping senses can be disorienting, compounding a sense
is likely extremely disorienting. Interestingly, Tin is possibly
more useful when not compounded, as a Tineye could burn
Tin and simultaneously store the senses they don't want
heightened to help combat the weakness of Tin.
Resonances: Feruchemical Tin may have an additional
resonance with Allomantic Bronze that would allow the
Allomantic senses created by burning Bronze to be stored in
a Tin metalmind.[262]
Savantism: Tin is one of the few metals we have a
confirmed Savant in, as Spook became a Tin savant by
flaring Tin for several months.[352] As Tin is an internal
physical metal, this gives us a nearly worst case perspective
of savantism. Of the base metals, only Pewter would be
more severe.[352] A Tin savant becomes almost senseless
without their metal burning, they find it difficult to see and
hear, and can hardly feel pain or heat.[85] This deadening
of sense is extreme enough that Tin savant can rush into a
burning building and not feel it.[86] On the flip side, when
burning Tin, a Tin savant's senses are magnified far beyond
what even enhanced Tin is capable of, to the point where
ordinary light is too bright to see in.[76] Tin savants usually
blindfold themselves, although even with their eyes obscured
to the point a normal person could not see, a Tin savant
can still function normally.[76] Similarly their other senses
are magnified beyond imagining to the point where they no
longer even need sight.[76] They can hear heartbeats[75]
and feel minor variations in the air that indicates motion.[83]
Hemalurgy: A Hemalurgic spike made from Tin steals the
same senses that it influences in the other 2 arts.[356]
Fabrial: In fabrial tech, Tin diminishes an element in its
vicinity. The best example being the painreal, a device that
decreases pain in its wearer.[309]
Trivia: Tin was almost misreported as being silver under
the mistaken belief that it was an ingredient in Pewter.[49]
Pewter
Allomancy: A Pewter Misting is called a Thug.[10] Pewter
is an Internal Pushing Physical metal.[354] Burning Pewter
results in the user gaining significant strength, and speed.[10] It also grants a small but significant healing factor,[79]
and heightens several internal senses such as balance and
proprioception.[29]
Pewter is an exceptionally dangerous metal to burn for
long periods[37][38] as it suppresses some warning senses
such as exhaustion and pain.[30] It is possible for a normal
thug to die from Pewter withdrawals after a long period of
burning. A burn such as this is referred to a Pewter drag.[39]
Feruchemy: A Pewter Ferring is called a Brute.[10]
Pewter can be used to store physical strength. When storing,
the Brute is weak and shriveled, but when tapping, a Brute's
muscles become physically larger and more powerful.[63]
Compounding: Compounding Pewter would allow for a
large amount of strength to be stored, however, with the
muscle size increase, only a portion can be tapped at any
time without loosing the ability to move effectively.[357]
Savantism: Pewter Savantism is exceedingly dangerous,
and frequently fatal.[352] The benefits would be a massive
increase in the potential output of Pewter, particularly in
healing factor.[127] However, the downsides may include
the inability to heal or move at all when not burning Pewter.[85] Since Pewter withdrawal after an extended burn can be
dangerous all on its own, the effects of a savant running out
of Pewter are probably devastating.[352] The only confirmed
Pewter Savant is Tarson, a koloss-blooded Vanisher.[127]
Hemalurgy: A Hemalurgic spike made from Pewter steals
physical Feruchemical powers.[356]
<<PAGE>>
Fabrial: In Fabrial tech Pewter does the opposite of Tin,
and creates an augmenter that enhances the element within,[308] notable examples are the heat radiating fabrials,[115]
and the one-off inverse painreal which can deliver extreme
pain at a touch.[305] Interestingly, Pewter fabrials consume
more Stormlight than other equivalent fabrials made with other
metals.[308]
Zinc
Allomancy: A Zinc Misting is called a Rioter.[10] Zinc is
an External Pulling Mental metal.[354] A Rioter can "pull"
on the emotions of another person making them stronger.[10]
A Rioter can not effect them self.[60] Except in the case
of Hemalurgic constructs,[59][64] a Rioter can not directly
control another person, and can only make them feel a specific
way.[28] The emotional influence can be quite subtle or
extremely powerful.[31]
Rioting has a few notable weaknesses, a person can be
trained to detect when emotional Allomancy is being used
on them,[26] a Bronze Seeker can determine which emotions are being manipulated,[35] and a Copper Smoker is
immune while burning.[30] Additionally the effects of Rioting
can not pass through Aluminum, so an Aluminum hat is
a viable protection as well.[120] Interestingly, the prime
researcher has also suggested that Shardplate helmets also
block emotional Allomancy,[349] although it is unknown
if emotional Allomancy can be used by someone wearing
Shardplate themselves.
A powerful Rioter,[352] a group of Rioters,[71] or an
enhanced Rioter[64] can take control of any Hemalurgic
construct[59][64] with 2[59] or more spikes that isn't already
being controlled by a more powerful entity.[70] It is unknown
if a non construct with 2 Hemalurgic spikes are also weak to
this effect. However, the effects of Rioting are more effective
against non constructs with any number of spikes.
Rioting can effect non human animals with some degree
of sapience.[222]
Feruchemy: A Zinc Ferring is called a Sparker.[10]
Zinc is classified a cognitive not mental Feruchemical metal,
although the difference seems academic.[355] A Sparker can
store mental speed. So by tapping Zinc, a Sparker can get a
"Spark" of genius.[10] Oddly this increased mental speed
makes the user hungry,[205] it is possible the energy required
to "overclock" the mind is not stored in the metalmind.
Compounding: Compounding Zinc is extremely potent,
as it would allow the user to gain near infinite intelligence.
This effect could meet or exceed the "Brightest" day where
Taravangian laid down the Diagram, an effective prediction
of all major events on Roshar for 5 years (including several
events that should not be predictable).[162][244] A Zinc
compounder could have access to this level of intellect if not
higher. It would likely be possible for a Zinc compounder
to create a new Hemalurgic construct. This is assuming the
effects of hunger don't kill the compounder.
It may be the case that "Mental Speed" and "Intelligence"
are not the same.[2] However, this distinction is debated
even outside of the scope of Feruchemical Tin.[5][8][4]
Savantism: Zinc Savantism is interesting. There are no
known Zinc Savants,[352] however it is quite similar to that
of Brass, and all Brass users known are nearly always burning
Brass.[52] This suggests there should be many Zinc and Brass
Savants. Possibly Zinc savantism shows minimal effects on the
user as Zinc is an external power. The effect could be simply
a more subtle control of emotion.
An interesting side effect is that it may be possible for
a person to become addicted to the effects of emotional
Allomancy being used on them, for example a Rioter rioting
their happiness. This could create a savant like effect in a
non Allomancer.
Hemalurgy: A Hemalurgic spike made from Zinc steals
"Emotional Fortitude."[356] It is unknown exactly what
this does, it is distinct from depression which is linked
to determination.[10] Possibly this creates a resistance to
Emotional Allomancy. In Kandra, Zinc spikes form the
Blessing of Stability[101] which does grant resistance to the
control of emotional Allomancy,[64][59] so this theory has
some backing.
Fabrial: In Fabrial Tech, Zinc increases the effect of
another fabrial.[306]
Brass
Allomancy: A Brass Misting is called a Soother.[10] Brass
is a Mental External Pushing metal.[354] Allomanticaly,
Brass is nearly identical to Zinc, except it suppresses emotions
instead of heightening them.[10] According the the prime
researcher, it can also be used to suppress a singers ability
to hear a rhythm.[251] This indirectly means a Rioter could
make it easier to hear a rhythm, or possibly force a rhythm
to be heard.
Feruchemy: A Brass Ferring is called a Pinnacle.[10] A
Pinnacle can store determination, becoming depressed while
storing, but being able to become manic by tapping. Like
Zinc, Brass is also classified Cognitive, not mental.[355]
The keen eyed among you may notice that this description
does not match up with the description as outlined in the
books or on the wiki, but does match with that of Electrum.
This is intentional. The official effect of Brass is storing heat,
when questioned why heat was a cognitive ability, the Prime
Researcher responded that he had made a mistake.[137] In
Mistborn: The Final Empire, the effect of Brass is listed as
storing heat, however this is incorrect. The mistake was not
caught until long after publishing, and rather than retconing
the effect, the prime researcher just swapped them in cannon.
This further reinforces that the Prime researcher can be
wrong.[21] The effect of Brass is really determination, not
<<PAGE>>
heat. As the purpose of this Journal is accuracy, not story
consistency, we will encourage the use of Brass and Electrum
with their correct effects, not their incorrect but official
effects. Only their Feruchemical effect was swapped, the
Allomantic and Hemalurgic effects remain unchanged.
Compounding: Compounding Brass allows for a large
amount of manic emotion to be built up and tapped as
needed. This is likely of minimal use other than mental
health. As metalminds are generally keyed, this is of minimal
use. If stored in unkeyed or unsealed metalminds, a Brass
compounder should be able to supply a large number of
depressed people with an anti-depression aid.
Savantism: Brass Savantism is likely similar to Zinc. As
noted in Zinc, there are oddly few Savants given most users
burn most of the time.[52]
Hemalurgy: A Hemalurgic spike made from Brass Steels
the Cognitive Feruchemical powers.[356]
Fabrial: In Fabrial Tech, Brass decreases the effect of
another fabrial.[306]
Bronze
Allomancy: A Bronze Misting is called a Seeker.[10]
Bronze is an Internal Pushing Mental metal.[354] A Seeker
can "feel" other Allomancers who are burning metals.[10] The
Seeker can feel direction and rough intensity, as determined
both by distance and strength of burn.[35] Each metal has a
unique feel, so a trained Seeker can determine which metals
are being burned. An extremely trained Seeker can detect what
emotion a Soother or Rioter is influencing.[35]
While generally used for finding active uses of Allomancy, it
should be possible for a Seeker to detect any investiture[282]
including Feruchemy,[194][332] Surgebinding (including
differentiating surges),[240] AonDor,[150] Awakening,[150]
Summoned Shardblades,[259] active Fabrials,[247][257]
the Rhythms of Roshar,[225] and possibly open Perpendicularities.[81] While not directly confirmed, a Seeker could
also probably detect a working Sandmaster and a coming
Highstorm. Shards can also create fake pulses to emulate
anything a Seeker can detect,[81][82] these can be targeted
at a specific Seeker.[82]
This feeling manifests as a specific "rhythm" of pulses,[35] similar to the Rhythms of Roshar (which a Seeker could
hear).[279][225] It is possible that the "tone" of the pulses
matches the shard responsible for the Investiture.[168][297]
So Allomantic pulses are heard in Preservation's tone. This
rhythm is unique to the metal, and can be used to infer the
classification of the metal being burned.[35]
Generally Seekers have difficulty detecting internal investiture such as Feruchemy,[194] however, it is demonstrably
possible to do.[332]
A powerful Seeker can pierce a Copper cloud (see Copper).[42] A Seeker likely can not pierce Aluminum, such as an
Allomancer in an Aluminum box.[248] This is not the most
relevant for Allomancy as most abilities would be relatively
useless in such a box, however compounders could safely
compound within such a box without being detected, and
fabrials can be used within one without being detected.
Feruchemy: A Bronze Ferring is called a Sentry.[10]
Similar to Brass and Zinc, the Feruchemical classification
is Cognitive, not mental.[355] Filling a Bronze metalmind
makes its user drowsy.[10] A Sentry can decide how long to
sleep, and fill a Bronze mind while sleeping. Bronze is the
only Feruchemical ability that can be used while sleeping.[65] This sleep likely does count as regular sleep.[36] This
wakefulness can be taped to keep the user awake and alert
indefinitely. A Sentry can also store "wakefulness" from
chemical stimulants such as caffeine, however tapping it
would then feel like using the stimulant.[320]
Compounding: Compounding Bronze is extremely useful,
in theory it can be used to stay awake forever with no
negative effects, and constantly feel alert and awake as
if well rested.[287] It should be noted at this point that
compounding becomes decreasingly effective over time as
more of the compounded attribute is used, so it is possible
that the longer such a compounded stayed awake, the more
frequently they would need to compound to do so.[125][47] It is unknown if a single nights rest would reset the
compounding requirement, and sudden withdrawal from
an extended Bronze compounded may be enough kill the
compounder.
Savantism: A Bronze Savant would have an expanded
range and increased Copper piercing power.[352][195][226]
They would also likely be able to determine more investiture
sources, such as being able to distinguish between Allomancy
and Compounding.[226] The downsides of Bronze savantism
are minimal, and many Seekers have likely become savants
without knowing.[352][195]
Hemalurgy: A Hemalurgic spike made from Bronze steals
Mental Allomantic powers.[356]
Feruchemy: In Fabrial Tech, Bronze allows for the creation
of remote triggers,[307] such as a fabrial that warns if anyone
new approaches within a specified range.[169]
<<PAGE>>
Copper
Allomancy: A Copper Misting is called a Smoker.[10]
Copper is an Internal Pulling Mental metal.[354] This exact
designation is mostly based on inference. A Smoker can burn
Copper to create a "Copper cloud" around them, this cloud
hides all investiture use within its radius from Seekers.[10]
Because of this, its Bronze pulse signature was not publicly
known for some time, and its placement was based on that
of its alloy Bronze.[35][30] It is possible for a Copper
cloud to be pierced by a powerful Seeker,[42] but it is
also possible for a Smoker to become more powerful to hide
from such a Seeker.[42] These power boosts can come from
various sources including skill, Hemalurgy, and enhancement
Allomancy, but if equal in power, Copper wins. A Seeker must
be significantly more powerful than the Smoker to pierce that
Smokers cloud.[42]
A Smoker can also hide other investiture sources and hide
from other detection sources.[257] For example, a Smoker
could likely approach a warning fabrial without triggering it.
This would also stop Awakeners lifesense/aura recognition.[191] Oddly the prime researcher has stated Copper clouds
can affect spren,[286] and prevent singers hearing or attuning
a Rhythm.[237]
A Smoker's mind is protected from emotional Allomancy
while burning.[30] It may be possible but difficult to extend
this in a bubble.[136]
It may be possible in a similar way to prevent a Lurcher or
Coinshot from using a piece of metal as an anchor. However
this is unknown. If possible, it may also be possible to block
any use of investiture such as the summoning of a Shardblade.[237][136][10] This is likely not possible for an unaided
Smoker, if at all.
It is unknown if a Smoker with Hemalurgic spikes is
protected from shard influence while burning. However, we
believe it is likely to a limited extent.
Feruchemy: A Copper Ferring is called an Archivist.[10]
Similar to Brass, Zinc, and Bronze, the Feruchemical classification is Cognitive, not mental.[355]
A Copper metalmind can be used to store memories without
them decaying. A memory stored in this way is forgotten
by the Archivist.[10] Memories stored in this fashion are
vulnerable to the manipulation of a shard.[67] An Archivist
can access individual memories in a Copper metalmind,[290]
and frequently create memory indexes[50] to help locate
them, similar to a hard drive. Memories do not decay within
a metalmind, but will decay when accessed since the memory
is moved to the Archivists mind temporarily.[53]
Only memories can be stored, not generic neuron patterns
such as skills or "muscle" memories.[275]
It may be possible that the "memory" of an on going
experience (such as Pain) can be stored in copper. This is one
possible explanation for a Painmind.[334]
Compounding: Copper compounding is an odd effect.
Memories are non-fungible, whereas all other stored attributes
are fungible. Compounding other attributes is as simple as
creating more of them, but what this would do to a memory
is not clear. It is our opinion that compounding Copper would
allow a memory to be copied. This would allow an Archivist
to store a memory, then compound that memory into 2 copies,
one to store in a metalmind, and one to remember in their
actual mind.
Savantism: A Copper Savant likely has an increased range
and Bronze resistance.[195] As most Smokers leave their
copper on continuously it is likely that nearly ALL Smokers
are Savants,[352] this goes some way to explaining why
NO unaided Seeker has pierced any Copper cloud in several
hundred years.[42]
Hemalurgy: A Hemalurgic spike made from Copper steals
mental fortitude, memory, and intelligence.[356]
Fabrial: Copper may have a use in Fabrial Tech, but it is
unknown what. It may invert a Bronze detector, or possibly
hide a Fabrial from being detected.
Aluminum
Innate Effects: Aluminum (also called Ralkalest[301]) is
a particularly noteworthy metal as it is nearly immune to all
investiture.[281] The only know exceptions are Feruchemicy,[355] and Hemalurgy,[356] in all other contexts (save
Allomantic burning[354]) Aluminum is immutable. It can
not be pushed by a Coinshot, nor pulled by a Lurcher,[10] and does not even have a metal line.[206] It does not
cast an Atium* shadow.[171] An Aluminum hat passively
protects is wearer from Brass, Zinc,[120] and shards.[241] An Aluminum box blocks detection void spren[304]
and presumably Seekers. It can not be Soulcast[254] or
Forged[143] into something else (although it can be created
by Soulcasting[165]). It can not be magically cut by a
Shardblade[311] (although a thin sheet could still be ripped
by one[319]), and can effectively contain Nightblood.[256]
No form of Surgebinding[311][250] or Voidbinding can
effect it or move through it.[301] If made into a non- Hemalurgic spike, it will block all magical healing factors
until removed.[170] It can not be Awakened,[186] and it
will block an Awakeners life sense.[257] In short, it is a
hard counter to all forms of investiture, full stop, however
it does not actively absorb investiture,[186] it just blocks
it. Aluminum can safely contain Aether spores and prevent
Silver from killing them.[18] A bottle made from Aluminum
would even be capable of removing invested liquid from a
perpendicularity for later use.[263]
<<PAGE>>
Allomancy: An Aluminum Misting is called an Aluminum
Gnat.[10] Aluminum is an Internal Pulling Enhancement
metal.[354] There are only 2 effects of burning Aluminum,
first the burner emits Allomantic pulses that can be detected
by a Seeker (presumably),[45] and second, all other ingested
metal reserves are erased.[10] As such, there is almost
no effect of burning Aluminum as a Misting. This is the
only known way to alter the form of Aluminum as it is
burned away by the Allomancer. Burning Aluminum would
almost certainly purge the body of all other invested fuels
such as Stormlight or BioChromatic breaths. Investiture is
purged quickly, but not instantly.[173] It may be possible
that Aluminum only suppresses BioChromatic breaths rather
than destroying them, but the only person known to have
both Allomantic Aluminum and Breaths is Hoid.[230][267][164][166] Burning Aluminum would repair the withering
damage dealt by a Threnodite Shade.[187] This MAY grant
the person burning it immunity to other investitures as well.
This is unknown, but given the nature of Aluminum it is likely.
Feruchemy: An Aluminum Ferring is called a Trueself.[10]
Feruchemical Aluminum is a Spiritual metal.[355] A Trueself
can create an Aluminum metalmind, this is one of only 2
known ways of changing Aluminum into something else. The
Trueself can store and retrieve Identity.[10] The effects of
this are not entirely known, but it has a large number of
ramifications, most notably Metalminds are keyed to Identity.
If a Feruchemist capable of storing multiple attributes (either
by being a Full Feruchemist or by gaining access to a second
through a method such as Hemalurgy), then storing Identity
while creating another metalmind at the same time will result
in the second metalmind being created WITHOUT an Identity
lock on it. As such, anyone who can tap that attribute can use
that metalmind.[205] It is unknown if the metalmind can be
refilled by anyone without keying it. In a similar fashion a
Trueself with BioChromatic breaths could Awaken an item
unkeyed so that anyone could retrieve the breaths.[192]
If a Ferring created an unkeyed Identity metalmind, a person
tapping it could then tap any metalminds keyed to that Ferring
since the identity to access them is available.[196]
Identity also has an effect on the regional accent of a person,[198] by storing Identity, and tapping Connection,[246][211]
a person can speak the local language without an accent.[198]
Compounding: Compounding Aluminum would create
more Identity. What this would do is unclear as most of the
uses for Aluminum Feruchemy involve "blanking" identity
by storing it, not making more of it.
Savantism: The effect of Aluminum savantism is unknown.
Officially they can "cleanse their spirit of unwanted investiture
effects".[140] These effects MAY include a Curse from the
Nightwatcher[117] or Midnight Sorceress.[17]
Hemalurgy: The Hemalurgic use of Aluminum is... odd.
An Aluminum spike will remove all investiture based powers
from its host.[356] As an Aluminum bullet does not do
this, it implies the Aluminum spike needs to be made into
a Hemalurgic spike by spiking another person before it
becomes active, especially since a victim is usually killed
during the creation of a spike making their lack of powers
rather irrelevant. Such a spike could be used as an effective
(if inhumane) method to restrain a powerful investiture user
(such as a Mistborn, Elantrian, etc) for an extended period.
We suspect the spike only suppresses the powers while it is
in place, and that removing it will restore the powers.
Fabrial: In Fabrial Tech, Aluminum has a unique use.
It blocks other effects. This has been used with conjoined
fabrials to limit the conjoining to a single axis,[300] and can
theoretically be used to make a directional attractor fabrial
or similar. This appears to be Aluminum base investiture
blocking effect, and not a unique effect to fabrials.
Duralumin
Allomancy: A Duralumin Misting is called a Duralumin
Gnat.[10] Duralumin is an Internal Pushing Enhancement
metal.[354] Duralumin only has an effect when burning other
metals. The effect of burning Duralumin while burning another
metal is extreme. The entirety of a persons metal reserve
in that metal is nearly instantly burned at max power and
is immediately used.[10] For example, a Mistborn Soothing
someone with a Duralumin fueled surge can completely blank
their emotions for a moment.[57] Duralumin is dangerous to
burn as not only can the sheer power released can be difficult
to control,[52] but also because all reserves of the metal are
now depleted.[58] Duralumin Iron, Tin, and Steel are only
safe when used in combination with Duralumin Pewter.[52]
Similarly to Aluminum, vast reserves are not instantly used,[173] but rather the burn time is dependent on the amount of
investiture to be burned.[345] In most contexts, this distinction
is academic.
A weak Allomancer burning Duralumin and Zinc or Brass
can take control of a Hemalurgic construct.[59][64]
Duralumin would also effect other investiture systems in a
similar manner.[272]
Feruchemy: A Duralumin Ferring is called a Connector.[10] Duralumin is a Spiritual metal.[355] As the name
suggests, Duralumin is used to store Connection. Connection
includes awareness of other people, friendship, and bonds.[10]
Storing connection does not allow an individual to bypass
planetary investiture connection.[155] The Nahel bond can
be stored in such a way, but this is probably a bad idea.[268]
Duralumin is also possibly a required ingredient in an
unsealed metalmind. The idea being, that it acts to connect
the wearer to the Nicrosil reserve.
Tapping connection allows for many things. Firstly, tapping
connection will connect the Connector to the geographic area
and will allow them to speak the local language,[211] all be
it with an accent. This would allow a connector to interpret
<<PAGE>>
the Rhythms of Roshar.[218] Secondly, any geographic
restrictions on investiture, such as Elantrian Aons, can be
overridden by retrieving the required connection from a
metalmind.[285]
Compounding: Compounding Connection would allow for
infinite connection. Apart from the obvious of allowing for
the creation of unkeyed translation metalminds,[211] this
connection can also be used directly to control Hemalurgic
constructs.[284] It is likely a Connection compounder would
be similar to a Bondsmith in some respects.[299]
Compounding while using Duralumin to enhance it would
be dangerous. The same amount of power would be created
all at once making it difficult to control and store. As
such, we would not recommend using Duralumin to boost
compounding in most cases.[202]
Savantism: The effect of Duralumin Savantism are
completely unknown. Duralumin does not increase available
power, it only makes it all available immediately. If one were
to theorize, it may be possible a Duralumin savant could
extend the surge time? This seems unlikely and there are no
recorded Duralumin savants to reference.
Hemalurgy: A Hemalurgic spike made from Duralumin
steals Connection and Identity.[202] Possibly this is related
to the ability to force another to take the weakness from a
Hemalurgic spike.[213]
Fabrial: There is no known use for Duralumin in Fabrial
tech. It may be undiscovered on Roshar.
Chromium
Allomancy: A Chromium Misting is known as a Leacher.[10] Chromium is an External Pulling Enhancement metal.[354] A Leacher can erase the metal reserves of another
person by touching them.[10] This is similar to burning
Aluminum, but in another person. A Leacher can drain other
investitures as well such as Stormlight[276] or BioChromatic
breaths.[277] A Leacher can effectively render any investiture
system unavailable including Feruchemical tapping,[315]
Shardblades,[260] and Fabrials,[351] but it can not Leach
the ability its self. This does not grant the investiture to the
Leacher.[351]
Feruchemy: A Chromium Ferring is called a Spinner,[10]
a Spinner can store Fortune, becoming unlucky as they fill,
and lucky as they tap.[10] Feruchemical Chromium is a
Spiritual metal.[355]
Compounding: Compounding Chromium is an extremely
scary prospect. Odium has implied fortune can be used to see
the future.[244] It is highly likely that compounding fortune
would allow a compounded to see the lines of fate around
them and predict the future.[249] This may be a byproduct
however, and not the complete effect. To pull an example from
fiction, we suspect a Chromium compounder would be similar
to Mobius boosted Nick Campbell from Drew Hayes' Super
Powereds.[6]
Another probable result of tapping or compounding fortune
is that shards can no longer predict the actions of the Spinner.
This has only been indirectly seen when Odium shows how
far into the future he can predict, and the only spot hidden
from him surrounds a individual with future sight.[312]
Savant: It is unknown what a Chromium savant would be
like, possibly it would allow the Leacher to leach at a small
range rather than just touch. A fortune compounding savant
is likely extremely dangerous.
Hemalurgy: The Hemalurgic use of Chromium is not
entirely known, existing sources list it merely as "probably
steals destiny."[356] Whether or not this is the actual effect
of Chromium is unknown, and what "stealing destiny" would
even do is also unknown.
Fabrial: It is not known if Chromium has a use in fabrial
tech, however, it has been shown it is possible to make a
fabrial that suppressesT radiant[298] or void[302] based
powers in an area. Given the Allomantic effect of Chromium,
it is not unreasonably to guess that it may be involved in the
construction of these fabrials.
Nicrosil
Allomancy: A Nicrosil Misting is called a Nicroburst.[10] Nicrosil is an External Pushing Enhancement metal.[354] Nicrosil has almost exactly the same Allomantic effect
as Duralumin, except the effect is in another person being
touched by a Nicroburster instead of in the Nicroburster
them-self.[10]
Feruchemy: A Nicrosil Ferring is called a Soulbearer.[10]
Feruchemical Nicrosil is a Spiritual metal.[355] A Soulbearer
can store investiture in a metalmind.[10] The exact effect
is complicated and possibly 2 fold. This appears to store
not only investiture, but also the ability to use it. If a full
Feruchemist created an unkeyed Nicrosil metalmind, they
could store their ability to use, say, Copper metalminds in
the Nicrosil metalmind. Another Ferring who is a Soulbearer
could then tap that metalmind and temporarily gain the ability
to use Copper metalminds. This can be used to store the
ability to use other investiture systems if the Soulbearer can
use them. This includes Feruchemy,[210] Allomancy,[214]
Stormlight surges,[221] Divine breaths,[221]Biochromatic
breaths,[316] and possibly Sandmastery. Interestingly, storing
investiture also hides a Soulbearer form an Awakener with
lifesense.[242] It should be noted that all individuals born in
the Cosmere have a small amount of innate investiture making
<<PAGE>>
them slightly more resilient than Earth Humans,[316] so there
is always an amount of investiture that CAN be stored.
Nicrosil is a key component in an unsealed metalmind as
it stores the ability to use the other metals in the metalmind.[210] The exact composition of an unsealed metalmind is not
yet known.
Compounding: Compounding Nicrosil is one of the most
useful things to do, as it allows the creation of more ability.
Consider the most powerful metalmind known, the Bands of
Mourning. This unsealed metalmind contains the ability to
use all 16 Feruchemical and Allomantic base metals,[214]
but since it is a metalmind, its power is limited and will
run out.[36] EXCEPT for Nicrosil compounding which the
Bands also transfer the ability to do. Someone compounding
Nicrosil with the Bands of Mourning could refill or even
copy them (assuming they know how to make an unsealed
metalmind). Nicrosil compounding logically leads to the
commodification of investiture. With Nicrosil compounders,
access to an investiture system could be as simple as
purchasing an unsealed metalmind with that system. As
Nicrosil compounders are only limited by the availability of
Nicrosil, so too would access to investiture systems become
limited only by Nicrosil.
Savantism: Similar to Duralumin, and Chromium, the
effects of Nicrosil savantism are unknown and difficult to
speculate about, although they are likely a hybrid of the two.
Hemalurgy: A Hemalurgic spike made from Nicrosil steals
Investiture,[356] unlike in Feruchemy this is specifically
the power its self, not the ability to use the power.[316]
Otherwise, this would render spikes such as Steel obsolete.
This can be used to steal BioChroma.[316]
Fabrial: There is no known use for Nicrosil in Fabrial tech.
It may be undiscovered on Roshar.
Gold
Allomancy: A Gold Misting is called an Auger.[10]
Gold is an Internal Pulling Temporal metal.[354] Gold is
regarded as mostly useless. The effect of burning Gold is
a hallucination that shows the Auger an alternative version
of themselves.[10] This "Gold shadow" has no useful
properties. It is purely speculative and changes based on
current conditions.[130] This shadow creates emotional
stress in an Auger because it is someone they could have
been.[46] This combined with the expense means even those
who can burn Gold rarely do.[46]
Feruchemy: A Gold Ferring is called a Bloodmaker.[10]
Feruchemical Gold is a "hybrid" metal (best thought of as
"abstract").[355] A Bloodmaker can store physical health.[10] While filling, a Bloodmaker does not heal or recover
from sickness, and also feels sick.[124] In return when
tapping, a Bloodmaker can heal wounds rapidly. Healing
a wound rapidly drains more stored health than filling one
slowly.[122] This can not be used to "heal" aging.[235]
This healing can also heal wounds to the soul such as those
dealt by a Shardblade[252] or shade[252] and can even be
used to restore attributes stolen by Hemalurgy.[151]
Compounding: A Gold Compounder is functionally
invulnerable. The amount of healing that can be built up is
enough to even repair lethal injuries such as decapitation,[178] flaying,[47] dismemberment,[47] or explosions.[128]
A Gold compounder can walk through fire without being
hurt,[47] and can even stop breathing by preventing cells
death from hypoxia.[127] A Gold compounder can heal fast
enough that they do not even feel pain from new wounds.[127] This may (or may not) be related to painminds.[334]
Savantism: Due to the negative effects of burning Gold,
it is unlikely there are any Pure Gold savants. However,
for those who can compound Gold, the health generated is
enough to compensate for the Allomantic effects of Gold, and
it is likely many of them are savants. A character reference
for a Gold savant is Miles Hundredlives.[293] Assuming
Miles is a Gold savant, one effect could be a reduction in the
negative emotions from burning Gold.[126]
Hemalurgy: A Hemalurgic spike made from Gold steals
one of the Hybrid Feruchemical powers.[356]
Fabrial: Oddly there is is no known Fabrial Tech use for
Gold. Roshar definitely has Gold although they do not use it
for currency,[245] and it seems unlikely that the scholars have
not tried a Gold Cage. Given the nature of Allomantic Gold,
and the existence of unexplained Fabrial Clocks on Roshar,[163] Gold may have an element of time keeping in a Fabrial.
Possibly causing the effect of the Fabrial to fluctuate over time.
This however, is only speculation.
<<PAGE>>
Electrum
Allomancy: An Electrum Misting is called an Oracle.[10] Electrum is an Internal Pushing Temporal metal.[354]
Electrum is basically the opposite of Gold, and gives a person
a view of their own potential futures.[10] The effects are
shorter in time distance than that of Gold, and only a few
seconds of future are visible. Never-the-less, burning Electrum
is enough of a glance into the future that it counters Atium*[70] (see section on God Metals), although it does not replicate
or detect its effects.[71]
Interestingly when combined with Duralumin/Nicrosil, the
primary researcher has stated that it would have an effect
similar to Duralumin Atium*[97] and allow the user to see
into the Spiritual Realm its self.[180] The effects of this are
most likely similar to compounding fortune.
Feruchemy: An Electrum Ferring is called a Firesoul.[10]
Feruchemical Electrum is a "hybrid" metal.[355] A Firesoul
can store heat.[10] It should be noted at this point, that due to
an accident, the primary researcher swapped the Feruchemical
effects of Brass and Electrum. For the sake of consistency, he
did not retcon this mistake later, and in canon, the effects
are swapped. As we are more concerned with accuracy than
narrative consistency, we take this accident for what it was;
a mistake.[137][21] As such, we have swapped the effects
of Brass and Electrum to their correct rather than canonical
effect.
Filling an Electrum metalmind Cools the Firesoul, and
draining it warms them. This would allow a Firesoul to
survive extreme heat by rapidly filling their metalmind,[138]
and likewise hypothermia could be resisted by draining one,
even in extreme cold.[212] A Firesoul gains a certain amount
of resistance to the excess heat of tapping a metalmind, but
not a complete one.[138] A Firesoul can accidentally injure
them-self by filling or tapping too fast.[217]
Compounding: Compounding Electrum is exceedingly
dangerous for the user as it would create a large amount
of heat that would immediately need to be stored or the
Firesoul would overheat.[217] This could be useful in cold
climates, but its primary application would most likely be
with producing unkeyed or unsealed heating metalminds.
Savantism: The effects of being an Electrum savant are
unknown. Presumably the distance one can see while burning
Electrum is increased. A possible downside would be the
inability to plan ahead or otherwise identify cause and effect,
however this is pure speculation.
Hemalurgy: A Hemalurgic spike made from Electrum
steals Enhancement Allomantic powers.[356]
Fabrial: There is no known use for Electrum in Fabrial
tech. It may be undiscovered on Roshar.
Cadmium
Allomancy: A Cadmium Misting is called a Pulser.[10]
Cadmium is an External Pulling Temporal metal.[354] A
Pulser can create a "slowtime bubble" around them.[10] This
bubble can be the size of a small room,[209][129] and time
within the bubble moves slower than time outside the bubble.[10] The compression ratio is enough to let real hours pass
in mere minutes from within the bubble.[129] Once created
the bubble is "stationary" relative to the perceived motion
of the Pulser; For example, the bubble will travel with a
train if created on board.[207] The bubble does not move
with the Pulser them-self, just their environment.[209] If the
Pulser exits their bubble, the effect ends.[209] Additional,
this stationary bubble effect can not be overcome simply by
pulsing the bubble on and off quickly, there is a minimum
time between bubbles.[121] There is a process known as
"sculpting" a bubble,[338] but it is not known if this is
creating a bubble with a specific shape, or just a specific
size. Given the events surrounding the detonation onboard the
Pewternaut A16,[345] we suspect the former case.
This time dilation effect bypasses regular relativity; ie an
observer outside of the bubble will perceive light as moving
slower within the bubble.[345]
The edge of the bubble is of great interest. Fast and
lightweight objects are deflected slightly when entering or
exiting.[128] Light is not red/blue shifted when passing the
bubble's edge.[220] One possible explanation for both of these
effects is that the edge of the bubble acts as a buffer and
takes the average of all light that strikes it over a short time,
then replicates it on the other side of the barrier. This could
be used to prevent red/blue shift but at the same time, light
that crosses the bubble will be delayed slightly from expected.
This combined with the transition between speeds of different
parts of a moving object should account for this. Additionaly,
moving objects are "stripped" of the extra energy they would
apparently gain when transition between times i.e. a bullet
fired into a slow time bubble would appear from within the
slow time bubble to move at the same speed as a regular bullet.[161] Touching the edge of a bubble is enough to subject an
individual to the time effect of the bubble,[338] non sentient
objects appear to act differently.[345]
It is also possible that both of these "effects" of time bubbles
where added for narrative convenience (no red/blue shift to
prevent detecting a bubble, deflection to prevent Bendalloy
sniper nests, etc) and are not actual effects.[161]
Using Allomancy targeting something in a area with slower
time than you has a similar effect as Duralumin as the power
released into the area over time is greater.
Feruchemy: A Cadmium Ferring is called a Gasper.[10]
Cadmium is a "hybrid" metal.[355] A Gasper can store
oxygen.[10] While storing, a Gasper must hyperventilate to
get enough oxygen. When tapping a Gasper does not need to
breath at all.
<<PAGE>>
Compounding: Naturally compounding Cadmium removes
the need to breath. Although as compounding involves
creating a slowtime bubble, it is likely harder to compound
effectively than most other metals. Care should be taken
when using stored breath exclusively to avoid withdrawal
problems similar to Gold and Bronze.[125][47]
Savantism: A Cadmium savant would be able to slow time
further and can carry their time bubble with them as they
move.[201][280] Additional the minimum time between
bubbles is decreased.[324] Due to time dilation it is likely
any Cadmium savant would be significantly different in lived
age vs real age.
Hemalurgy: A Hemalurgic spike made from Cadmium
steals Temporal Allomantic powers.[356]
Fabrial: There is no known use for Cadmium in Fabrial
tech. It may be undiscovered on Roshar.
Bendalloy
Allomancy: A Bendalloy Misting is called a Slider.[10]
Bendalloy is an External Pulling Temporal metal,[354] and
is almost the exact opposite of Cadmium. Bendalloy creates
a "fasttime bubble" similar to a Cadmium bubble, but where
the time inside the bubble is extended relative to the outside.[10] These bubbles are considerably smaller than Cadmium
can create, about 1.5 meters in radius,[128] although the
exact radius is hard to measure as touching any part of it
counts as being "in" the bubble.[338] Bendalloy also burns
much faster than Cadmium,[207] with 1 easily ingest-able
Bendalloy nugget providing only 2 minutes of burn time. This
is further shortened by the burner being IN the fast time
bubble, and such a bubble will only last for about 15 real
seconds before the ingested Bendalloy is consumed.[124]
If a Bendalloy bubble is created within a Cadmium bubble
the overlapping region has the average time of the 2 regions.
For 2 similar strength Mistings, this would create an area with
the same time as that outside the bubbles.[124]
As a Bendalloy bubble can move with a large object,[207]
and the area inside bypasses relativity, Bendalloy bubbles can
be used create FTL ships. This is likely impractical given
the time and volume limitations on Bendalloy and likely
requires Compounding Investiture. In any event, a Savant[209] Slider Skimmer[24] should be able to easily manage
8x light-speed in a vacuum, although the survivability of
doing so is questionable.
Feruchemy: A Bendalloy Ferring is called a Subsumer.[10] Bendalloy is a "hybrid" metal.[355] A Subsumer
can store caloric energy.[10] While storing, a Subsumer
can eat any amount of food without becoming "full" or
gaining weight. The calories within the food are stored in
the metalmind for later retrieval.[10] The substance of the
food however, is not stored. A Subsumer who is filling their
metalmind would still need to use the bathroom at the same
rate as would be expected for that amount of consumption
and does not need to while tapping.[322]
We suspect that a Bendalloy metal mind storing water could
fill the hydration requirement for Sandmastery[236] and the
Luhel bond[20]. However, this has not been confirmed.
Compounding: Compounding Bendalloy allows
a Twinborn to never need to eat, although similar
to compounding wakefulness, rapid withdrawal from
compounding after a long fast may kill them.[47][125] Of
particular note is that compounding mental speed requires
greater caloric intake, and is likely only practical when also
compounding energy. Naturally doing so would require 4
metals in 2 systems, so some method to gain more powers is
required to do this method.
Savantism: A Bendaloy savant is similar to a Cadmium
savant and can "carry" their speedbubble with them.[201]
The speedbubble would also have increased dilation and
radius,[280] and decreased minimum time between bubbles.[324] Wayne may be a a Bendalloy savant, although this
has not been confirmed and he shows no sign of being able
to "carry" the bubble.[324][338][345] This implies that
"sculpting" bubbles may be something a savant could do.
Hemalurgy: A Hemalurgic spike made from Cadmium
steals Spiritual Feruchemical powers.[356]
Fabrial: There is no known use for Bendalloy in Fabrial
tech. It may be undiscovered on Roshar.
V. NOTABLE OTHER METALS
Silver
Silver is inert in all known metallic arts.[87] It can not
be burned,[354] no attribute can be stored in it,[355] and
a spike made out of it will not absorbed anything regardless
of where it is placed.[356] Like all other metals it can be
pushed and pulled by Steel/Iron,[181] and has no effect on
any mental Allomancy.[144] And it has no known use in
Fabrial tech. In context of these 4 arts, silver does nothing,
and has no notable features.[238] However, it has been
included in this paper because of some unique interactions.
Aether spores are destroyed by silver.[14] This affect
appears to radiate out from the silver and can destroy spores
quite a distance from the Silver its self.[16] This does not
appear to damage the Silver. Silver can also be used to cut
Aether manifestations with ease.
In a similar way, on Threnody, the shades are repelled by
silver.[149] Touching silver to a shade hurts it,[147] and they
can not cross above silver.[149] This makes a line of silver
the only known way to keep a shade in or out of an area.
<<PAGE>>
[147] Silver also heals newly inflicted shade wounds.[148]
The silver is corroded by this process and no longer has this
effect afterward.[147]
It is entirely possibly that the "silver" on Threnody is only
a silvery metal such as Aluminum or Steel. Threnodite silver
being Aluminum would explain some of its shade defeating
properties, however, the prime researcher has also suggested it
may be possible to use a dagger of silver to kill a spren, and
that an Aluminum dagger would not work.[348] Additionaly,
we have confirmation from Hoid that Lumar "Silver" IS Silver[15] and not Aluminum.[18] This makes it sound as if silver
may have specific interactions with cognitive shadows or other
denizens of the cognitive realm.
Alternatively, as the Threnodite shades are not definitively
linked to any Shard, and both Spren[258] and Aethers[336]
predate the shattering of Adonalsium. As Silver affects all 3 in
similar ways, it may be part of a far older investiture system
than we have covered.
There is another possible object that uses silver. There are
some chains that originate from Threnody than can be used to
"anchor" a user though a cognitive anomaly (the meaning of
which is unclear).[288][303] These chains are described as
"silvery" in description and may be a method of worldhopping.
These may or may not be connected to the actual metal silver.
Nightblood's sheath is originally described as silver, but it
was later confirmed to be Aluminum.[111][256]
VI. GOD METALS
The god metals are a particularly tricky topic. These metals
are physical manifestations of a Shards power.[94] As there
are 16 shards, it stands to reason that there would be 16 god metals,[231] HOWEVER, each metal is named after
the Vessel, not the Shard (with a few exceptions), and Sazed
created his own god metal distinct from the existing ones
associated with Preservation and Ruin.[179][273] This may
mean that each shard can have multiple metal. To make things
worse, there is another composite shard,[11] the Dor, that has
No vessel,[116] but does have a potential god metal.[291]
Annoyingly this means there is no hard maximum number
of god metals, and no minimum (other than the enumerated
metals). The number of god metals is most likely 18*, but this
can not be confirmed. It is likely that each god metal has at
least 1 alloy with each base metal,[271] and 2 with each other
god metal.[261] This would bring the total number of usable
metals by a full Mistborn to about 900. In general, each god
metal can not be mined,[32] and must be directly manifested
by the shard.[305] There is a way to make a metal without a
Shard, but the exact method is unknown.[294]
All god metals and their alloys theoretically have an Allomantic, Feruchemical, and Hemalurgic effect,[103] and
probably a use in Fabrial Tech,[295] as well as the metals
innate effect.[103] Creating more intrinsically weakens a
shard.[68][352] Burning any of them enough to become a
savant would lead to ascending to holding the shard.[139] The
exact amount any shard can create is unknown, however Ruin
was severely weakened after a room sized repository was filled
with Atium,[97] so shards generally limit the production.
All god metals are difficult (possibly impossible) to melt.[326] Given that gas and liquid forms of a shards essence are
not noticeably hot, it stands to reason that god metals do not
change phase with temperature.
This property makes some god metals difficult to shape as
they do not necessarily soften when heated and can not be
cast.[331]
All god metals also have a unique spectrum pattern. When
heated the metal emits light evenly on an impulse function
where most frequencies are the same moderate intensity, but
the frequency of the shard is impossibly high.[326]
Care needs to be taken when storing god metals. Each
is made almost entirely of pure investiture, and if enough
investiture is stored in an area, a perpendicularity can form,[342] thus large amounts of god metals should not be stored
in a single location.[327]
It is likely that a Hemalurgic spike made out of any god
metal has the ancillary effect of connecting the bearer to that
shard and facilitating communication.[331] This may be a
base property of the metal, and not related to Hemalurgy, or
this may be unique to Trellium.
As this topic is so nebulous, and shards have no particular
grouping, we will start with the known god metals. Names
marked with an * indicate they where constructed by appending -ium to the Vessel or Shard by the authors, these names
are placeholders only.
Lerasium[106]
Lerasium is an irritating metal. It is the god metal of
Preservation's first Vessel.[188][172][188][106] In theory,
Sazed could create more.[174] It is unknown if he has.
Lerasium is the only known metal that can be burned by a
non Allomancer, burning it immediately makes the person
who burnt it into a powerful Mistborn.[66][70][112][157]
Lerasium has an unknown Feruchemical and an unknown
Allomantic effect when used by a Mistborn. Likely it makes
a Mistborn more powerful. Since Lerasium is the physical
essence of Preservation, and the Scadrian Mists are also
Preservation's essence,[94] burning Lerasium as a Mistborn
may have a similar effect to burning the mists, i.e. A temporary
boost in power, and a filling of all 16 basic metal reserves.[93]
The Hemalurgic use of Lerasium is to steal all abilities
from its target.[356] This does not include investiture
abilities, only innate abilities like strength and speed.[316][317] Naturally this is considered a waste of Lerasium
compared to its other potential uses.[193]
Lerasium can be alloyed with any base metal.[271]
Anyone can burn the resulting alloy to become a Misting in
<<PAGE>>
that metal.[219] The other Allomantic, Feruchemical, and
Hemalurgic effects of these alloys are not known.
Now the exceptionally irritating part. Lerasium can be
alloyed with any god metal. Anyone can burn the resulting
alloy to gain that Shards investiture system.[261] The exact
meaning of this is unknown as not all Shards have innate investiture systems, Ruin for example. Theoretically this method
could be used to become a Sandmaster, create BioChromatic
Breaths, gain the 10 Stormsurges, their Lifelight counterparts,
or the 9 void surges.
From this we can infer that there are at least 2 alloys
between god metals, as all can Alloy with Lerasium to produce
the above effect, but Lerasium isn't "special" so it follows
that there is a second alloy for each with Lerasium where the
Lerasium is secondary.
Atium[229]
Atium is the one of the few god metal known to be mineable. It (or rather its alloy[356][321]) was extruded from
geodes in the Pits of Hathsin.[32] This is part of Preservation's
prison for Ruin,[352] as the Pits were the area around Ruin's
Perpendicularity[230] and Ruin was weakened by not having
access to the Atium produced.[68]
The Atium available in the final empire[32] is actually
Atium-Electrum alloy when mined.[321] This goes a long
way to explaining Atium's effects. We know this is the case
for several reasons and the primary researcher has confirmed
it. Most telling is that exactly 1/16 of those struck with
mist sickness got access to Atium.[90] As there are 16 base metals it would not make sense for these to directly be
Atium Misting as then a base metal would have been left
out. If Aluminum or Duralumin were excluded for being
"useless", the sign of 16 would have broken, as people might
have realized that those 2 where excluded, leading to the
belief in 18 metals. However, if this 1/16 had access to
Electrum, it would make sense they would also gain access
to Atium-Electrum.
First we will address Atium its self. Refined Atium
theoretically has an Allomantic and Feruchemical use, but
they are currently unknown. Its Hemalurgic use is to steal any
power.[356] It has a higher efficiency than other spikes.[107]
There are 2 known Alloys of Atium, the Hemalurgic effect
is not known for either.
Atium*:
Atium* is the default state of Atium as we known it, and
is an alloy of Atium and Electrum.[321] In this paper, this
alloy is referred to as Atium* as its real name is unknown,
and "Atium" is its defacto name. The primary Researcher has
stated that going forward, pure Atium will have a different
name.[350]
When used in Allomancy Atium* allows the user to see
and interpret the future for a few seconds. This allows its user
to become a nearly unstoppable force.[33] The only limit to
this is someone else burning Atium*[32] or Electrum,[70] as
they can also see the same futures and react to them creating
a reaction feedback loop. It is also possible for someone to
create 2 equally likely futures and to pick between them
based on the reaction of an Atium* burner.[61] Likely a
Spinner could also counter Atium* by tapping Fortune.
The Feruchemical use of Atium* is to store age.[9] The
Lord Ruler used this to become functionally immortal via
Compounding.[123] Extreme caution should be executed
when Compounding Atium*. The amount of age required
depends on the real age of the compounder, so over time
the same amount of compounded age will not stretch as far.
Stopping compounding is likely fatal for anyone extending
their life. This may be because they revert to their actual
age instantly, or because they are aging at an advanced rate.
Either way, Atium* compounding withdrawal after 1000
years of compounding rendered the Lord Ruler helpless (but
alive) within seconds of losing his metalminds.[47]
Malatium:
Malatium is an alloy of Atium and Gold.[104] Only the
Allomantic use is known. Burning Malatium produces a Gold
Shadow of another person.[9]
The theoretical alloys of Atium and the other 14 base metals
are deserving of a paper of their own.
Harmonium (Ettmetal)[179]
When Sazed took control of Preservation and Ruin[98] to
create the combination shard Harmony,[128] he also created
his own god metal, he did not like the sound of Sazedium,
so named it Harmonium.[179] This metal is also called
Ettmetal.[199] Sazeium might be a better fit, as the metal
reacts violently with water[211] similar to Cesium.[200][23]
Unlike most god metals, Harmonium exhibits 2 impulse peaks,
Ruin's and Preservation's.
Harmonium seems to have been created specifically to
NOT be used in Allomancy or Hemalurgy. It has properties
in both,[103] but as it is highly reactive with water,[211] it
would be difficult to use in either.
Its direct Feruchemical properties are also unknown.
There is however, a unique property to Harmonium. When
investiture is used near near by Harmonium, it is absorbed
into the Harmonium and then radiated outward.[209] This
can be used to create airships by radiating the effect of a
Skimmer to an entire ship and make it weightless.[210] There
may be a distinction between Allomantic and Feruchemical
radiation. Allomantic radiation has shown to be spherical,[209] Feruchemical however seems to be more limited. The
Malwish Airships can become weightless, but the crew still
requires unsealed Iron metalminds.[210] This suggests that
Feruchemical properties are not radiated in the same way as
<<PAGE>>
Allomantic ones, possibly Feruchemical powers are limited
to objects touching the Harmonium, or possibly only to non
sentient objects.
This radiation is highly likely to be controllable with
Aluminum, making it toggle-able or directional.
It is likely that Harmonium is a key component in an unsealed metalmind. A theoretical way to construct an unsealed
metalmind would be to take a small piece of Harmonium
connected to an unkeyed Nicrosil metalmind charged with
the desired ability. If the Harmonium can access the Nicrosil
metalmind on its own (possibly by manipulating connection) it
should be able to radiate it to whoever touches it, thus granting
the ability to the wearer.
Another possibility is that the Nicrosil in a unsealed metalmind is actually an alloy of Nicrosil and Harmonium, and this
allows the direct creation of an Unsealed Nicrosil metalmind.
This may also be the Feruchemical use of Harmonium:
Nicrosil, but unsealed.
The exact method to construct unsealed metalminds is as
yet unknown, and this is pure speculation.
It is possible to split Harmonium into Atium and Lerasium,[345] although this NOT a typical metallurgical or chemical
process, but a nuclear one.[329] The current method is
to heat a bead of Harmonium until it softens slightly, and
then pulling it apart slightly. This causes the Atium and
Lerasium to split. If cut at this point, the 2 parts reverts to
being 2 blobs of Harmonium.[328] We suspect that using
an Aluminum knife dividing an Aluminum box may have a
different effect, but this has not been tested. The successful
method of splitting Harmonium involves using Trellium as
a "knife".[328] This results in an explosion that produces
trace amounts of Atium and Lerasium.[329][345] On the
down side, there is also an investiture to energy conversion.
In this case about 8g of Harmonium yielded 500 kJ energy,
even in imperfect conditions. Once perfected, this could lead
to a bomb capable of unrivaled destructive potential,[345] or a
Lerasium manufacturing system. Harmony claims the Kandra
have found a safer way to split Harmonium that destroys the
Lerasium and leaves only Atium,[346] but we suspect he is
lying to Kelsier to prevent Mistborn Proliferation.
Raysium[134]
Raysium is the god metal of Odium and has been described
as "bright Golden, almost white" in appearance.[305]
Raysium is an interesting metal and acts as a directional
investiture pump. What makes the metal inherently directional
is unknown, but investiture from one end is moved to the
other. So if 2 gemstones are connected with a length of
Raysium, it will force the Stormlight out of one and into
the other. This likely works with all investitures, not just the
light based ones.[305] We propose referring to the end that
the investiture is channeled to as the "positive" end, and the
other as the "negative" end for convenience.
Raysium has an interesting use in Fabrial tech. If
the gemstone drained is part of a conjoined fabrial, the
conjoinment transfers to the new gemstone. If the new
gemstone is a different size than the original, the conjoinment
acts like a gear ratio based on gem size. So if a conjoinment
is transferred to a gem half the size as the other side, the new
side will move twice as far with half as much force when the
first side is moved.[305]
Oddly enough, Raysium is another potential candidate to use
in the construction of an unsealed metalmind. It is theoretically
possible that when a metalmind is connected to the negative
side of a Raysium spike, the stored attribute is "injected" into
anything (or anyone) touching the positive side. However, it
is highly unlikely (bordering on impossible) that this is the
method currently being used on Scadrial.
Tanavastium*[133] and Koravarium*[22]
The Rosharan Shardblades and shard plates are alloys of
Honor and Cultivation's god metals while manifested in the
real world. There are at least 10 alloys of these, 1 for each
order of knights radiant.[271] We do not have a sample of
Cultivation's metal alone, but the Honorblades of the Heralds
are made from Honor's metal.[313] This may imply that
Honor has 10 metals, or that another process makes the
Honorblades distinct from each other.
A Mistborn burning Tanavastium would possibly
temporarily gain access to 2 surges, this is only hypothetical,
and would likely not be possible to test unless there are non
Honorblade samples.
Trellium[253] and Bavadinium*
Trellium is a god metal of Autonomy.[330] It is described
as silvery with a red tint and dark red spots similar to rust.[188] This metal is capable of forming Hemalurgic spikes that
can allow a Kandra to use Allomancy or Feruchemy.[182]
This Metal is also used to create single spike Hemalurgic
"Zombies" called Chimeras.[183] Additionally a spike of
Trillium in a regular human allows for 1 additional ability
WITHOUT becoming vulnerable to Harmony's direct control.[323][344] This spike also serves to connect its bearer in a 2
way communication channel to the local Avatar of Autonomy
Trell.[331] This likely can be used to contact Autonomy
herself if no local Avatar is present.
We speculate Trellium may act as a "combination spike"
and allow for the creation of a single spike that grants
multiple different abilities. This could help explain how it
can make powerful Hemalurgic creations with only a single
spike, but this explanation is not directly supported.
It does have a Allomantic and Feruchemical property, but
neither are known. However, its Feruchemical property MAY
be to store pain.[334]
<<PAGE>>
Trellium is repulsed by Harmonium and Allomancy.[328]
This should allow for a passive Allomancy detector. This can
also be used to cause Harmonium to split in a nuclear-esque
reaction.[328][345] Only a small amount of Trellium is
needed as a trigger.
Due to these unique properties, we suspect that Trellium is
not Autonomies ONLY metal, but rather the one specifically
tuned to fight Harmony. We have no direct evidence for this
save the name and the above highly specific properties.
Dorium*
The Shards of Devotion and Domination were splintered on
Sel,[11][116] rendering Aonaium* and and Skaium* most
likely inaccessible. Afterwards however, the remnants of their
power fused into 1 combined shard with no Vessel called the
Dor.[11] The primary researcher has claimed that the Dor
has a metal of its own.[291] This may be an alloy, or it may
be unique. Currently we have no confirmed sightings of this
metal. Possible candidates include a mysterious metal box
that can contain a Seons, but this is not necessarily even likely.
There is a method of harvesting the Dor and purifying it
into pure liquid investiture that can be used to replace any
investiture source.[343] We suspect this material has very
little to do with the Dorium*.
Daium*
The shard of Ambition was splintered in the Threnody
system.[12] As noted previously in the Silver section,
Threnody seems to have a silvery metal with unique
properties.[149][288][303] It is possibly this is Daium*
(the metal of Ambition). This however, is purely speculation.
Other
There are currently no known Edgliium* samples. The
names of the Vessels holding the shards of Invention, Mercy,
Vallor, Whimsy have not yet been revealed; and 2 shards
name's have yet to be revealed (one possibly being Wisdom).
They may or may not have god metals and may or may not
be splintered. Given the disjunctive nature of shards and their
metal, speculation on what these metals Would do IF they
existed seems counterproductive at this point.
Adonalsium-ium*?
It is unknown if Adonalsium had a metal pre-shattering
or not. We do not even know what Adonalsium really is.
Given the -ium postfix, it is entirely possible Adonalsium
is actually Adonals' metal. The primary researcher has
insinuated that details about the shattering of Adonalsium
will be in a book called Dragonsteel. This makes it possible
that Dragonsteel is Adonalsium's metal. As noted previously,
all facts surrounding Adonalsium are shrouded in mystery, so
this is complete speculation.
VII. HEMALURGIC CONSTRUCTS
As mentioned earlier, there are only 5* known Hemalurgic
constructs. All seem to have an affinity to death,[56][352][89][183][48][52][44] and all other than the Kandra seem
to enjoy killing.[73]
Steel Inquisitors
Steel inquisitors have between 11 and 21 spikes.[48][74]
2 Steel spikes through the eyes,[26] 2 between the ribs,
granting the physical Allomantic powers,[71] 4 Bronze spikes
between the ribs granting Mental Allomancy,[74] 1 Atium
spike in the chest for Allomantic Atium, and Gold spike in the
ribs for Feruchemical Healing,[92] and a single coordination
"lynch pin" spike between the shoulders.[47][13] Some post
release inquisitors including marsh also have Pewter spikes
for Feruchemical speed,[71] Brass spikes for Feruchemical
mental speed,[234] and Electrum spikes for enhancement
Allomancy.[92] Inquisitors are the only Hemalurgic construct
shown to have Allomancy and Feruchemy without the use of
Trellium spikes, and appear to be what you would get if you
attempted to create a Mistborn through Hemalurgy.
Inquisitors can "see" through their Iron or Steel.[45] They
can sense even minute amounts of metal in non metallic
objects, and even determine which metal it is.[100][80]
This sight may be directly into the cognitive realm and does
not require burning metals.[346] All Steel Inquisitors can be
controlled by Ruin[74] or a powerful Allomancer.[91]
If the lynch pin spike is removed, or the 2 Steel spikes in
the head are separated from it, the Inquisitor dies.[47]
Kolass
Kolass are brutes created with 4 identical Iron spikes
charged with strength.[352] They never stop growing and
become nearly mindless beasts.[56][352] They are extremely
susceptible to control by Allomancers and Ruin.[352][68]
Kolass can bread with regular humans to produce children
who are unusually strong, however, these children are human,
not Kolass.[7]
Chimera
Chimera[185] were created from humans by an unknown
shard acting through a Kandra. They have a single Hemalurgic
spike of Trellium. Chimera are fast feral creatures that move
on 4 "legs" and excel at tracking and pursuit similar to a dog.[183]
<<PAGE>>
Kandra
The Kandra are the most interesting Hemalurgic construct.
They are created from 2 unique spikes called "blessings".[352][182] Unlike other constructs, they are made from mist
wraiths, not humans.[352] Once spiked, a mist wraith slowly
becomes sapient over about 200 years.[72][34] Kandra can
specialize their body into any soft tissue including any organs
as needed.[69] If a Kandra is provided something to use
as a skeleton it can form a full body, and if a Kandra is
provided a corpse, it can perfectly copy it after digesting it.[51] Kandra can take the shape of humans[29] or animals.[51] The blessing spikes seem to be extremely low power
Hemalurgic spikes.[278][352] 4 blessings are known, but
more are possible.
Blessing of Awareness: 2 Tin spikes, charged with external
senses, functioning similar to always on Allomantic Tin.[352][278][356]
Blessing of Potency: 2 Iron spikes, charged with strength,
functioning similar to always on Allomantic Pewter, but less
powerful.[352][278][356]
Blessing of Presence: 2 Copper spikes, charged with
Mental Speed, that grant enhanced mental capacity, resistance
to insanity, and resistance to ruins control.[352][78][102][278][356]
Blessing of Stability: 2 Zinc spikes, charged with
Emotional Fortitude, that grant resistance to Allomantic
control.[352][278][356]
All Kandra are weak to being controlled by an Allomancer.[59] A Kandra can survive with only 1 spike,[182] but slowly
goes mad.[182] If a Kandra loses both its spikes for a time,
it begins to develop holes in its memory.[215] A Kandra can
survive with at least 4 spikes without becoming noticeably
weaker.[77] A Kandra can be controlled by a shard only if
it has 2 or more spikes.[182][184] Even then a Kandra is
capable of removing its own spikes to break the control.[95]
Additionaly Kandra can trigger a inevitable self destruct cycle
killing them-self. This can also be done last minute to prevent
a shard from taking control.[184]
Kandra age incredibly slowly and have natural life spans
somewhere around 1000 years.[269]
Metal Mutants
The term "Metal Mutant" refers to a variant of Chimera.[341] This term is known to be incorrect, but no other name
is presented. Metal Mutants are a Chimera variant created
by the set that feature 2 spikes rather than one.[340] They
appear more controllable than regular Chimera, although this
may just be the situation we see each in. It is unknown what
level of intervention Autonomy had in their creation, but it is
possible Metal Mutants are the only Construct created entirely
by unassisted humans. We suspect there was some intervention
from Autonomy, possibly just the original Chimera, that the
Set iterated on.
Despite having 2 spikes, Harmony is apparently unable to
control them, possibly because both spikes are Trellium, and
possibly because of the Blinding by Autonomy.
The Sovereign*
The Sovereign is an odd case, and his exact nature is
unknown. However, in his current state he very much benefits
from a state change due to Hemalurgy. In a nutshell, the
Sovereign is a Mistborn Cognitive Shadow who spent about a
year imprisoned within the well of ascension and later became
the vessel of Preservation for a short time.[228] This is the
only know time a Cognitive Shadow has held a shard, and he
is the only known sliver who remained as a Cognitive Shadow
after giving up a shard.
This Cognitive Shadow has since been pined to a physical
body using a single Spike through the right eye. This allows
the Sovereign to use the body as a body, and see in both the
physical and cognitive realm. This is compared to the sight of
an Inquisitor. The Sovereign does not need to burn metal to
use this sight, and in fact can no longer burn metals.[346]
Attentive readers may question the earlier "affinity to
death" for the Sovereign, but we would like to remind the
reader that in life, this man gleefully slaughtered hundreds[29] and after death, Ruin claimed him as his own.[232]
VIII. OTHER USES OF HEMALURGY
Hemalurgy can effect almost all investiture systems.[141] 2
spikes can steal the abilities of an Elantrian. 1 for power, and 1
for the requisite connection to Sel to use it.[154] Theoretically
spiking a person with a spike created on Sel for connection
would put them in the pool to become an Elantrian.[197]
A spike resists being awakened,[203] and spikes can be
used to steal a Divine breath.[283] As this breath is no longer
sustaining live, the person who received it would NOT need a
weekly breath.[296] Most likely regular BioChromatic breaths
could also be stolen in this way.[316]
The Nahel bond can be stolen with Hemalurgy, but the spren
could still choose to sever it. To effectively steal surge binding,
both the spren and radient would need to be spiked.[239]
A dead shardblade can be stolen with a Hemalurgic spike,[265] but the time to summon it would increase through
Hemalurgic decay.[265]
An old magic boon or curse could be stolen with Hemalurgy.
It is possible but difficult to steal just one half of the booncurse pair.[266]
It is possible to steal singer forms with Hemalurgy.[177]
An Aviar's Gift can also be stolen, however this is even
harder than a Nahel bond.[239]
<<PAGE>>
IX. TERMINOLOGY
It is useful to have standard shorthand when referring to
these arts. As such we propose the following non cannon
shorthand.
A metalmind of a specific metal can be referred to as
a[metal]mind, for example a Copper metalmind could be
referred to as a Coppermind.
When referring to specific metals, a prefix can be used to
specify the system. "A" for Allomantic, "F" for Feruchemical,
"H" for Hemalurgic, and "T" to specify both Allomantic
and Feruchemical access. For a Hemalurgic spike, this can
be postfixed with "[[attribute]]" to specify which attribute
is stored within the spike. Additionally, "h" can be used to
specify a power is gained through Hemalurgy, and "u" can
be used to specify it is gained from an unsealed metalmind.
For example a Bloodmaker Slider using a heating metalmind
while pierced with a Steel spike holding Tin Allomancy, could
be referred to as a Person with A-Bendalloy, F-Gold, uF-Iron,
uF-Nicrosil, uF-Electrum, hA-Tin, the spike its self would be
an H-Steel[Tin] spike.
Terms with the same prefix may be combined, so the same
person could also be A-Bendalloy, F-Gold, uF-Iron-Nicrosil-
Electrum, hA-Tin. The u and h are optional unless additional
clarity is needed.
A power that has been boosted by Duralumin or Nicrosil
and be indicated with the postfix "+", so Duralumin Steel
push would be A-Steel+.
C can be used as a prefix for compounding, so C-Gold
indicates that Health is being compounded.
The following metal abbreviations based on the periodic
table are also proposed. In cases with multiple acceptable
abbreviations, secondary abbreviations are included in ().
|Metal|Abbr|Metal|Abbr|Metal|Abbr||
|Aluminum|Al|Copper|Cu(Co)|Pewter|Pw(P)||
|Bendalloy|Bl|Duralumin|Du(D)|Steel|St(S)||
|Brass|Br|Electrum|El(E)|Tin|Sn(T)||
|Bronze|Bz|Gold|Ag(G)|Zinc|Zn(Z)||
|Cadmium|Cd|Iron|Fe(I)||
|Chromium|Cr|Nicrosil|Nc(N)||
Secondary letters in the abbreviation may be expressed
as subscripts if wished. The previous example can now be
expressed as A-Bl, F-G, uF-INE, hA-T.
Should it become necessary, God Metals have also been
given abbreviations. These can be added to the abbreviation
of a metal to indicate an alloy. These should be Bold or
BLACKBOARDBOLD to indicate their difference from
other prefixes and metals.
|Metal|Abbr|Metal|Abbr|Metal|Abbr||
|Atium|A|Lerasium L|Harmonium|H||
|Trellium|T(B)|Raysium|R|Tanavastium*|S||
|Koravarium*|K|Dorium*|O|Daium*|D||
|Edgliium*|E|Invention-ium|I|Mercy-ium|M||
|Valor-ium|V|Whimsy-ium|Y|Wisdom-ium|W||
|Aonaium*|N|Skaiium*|K|UNKNOWN|U||
This list is subject to change as new metal names are
revealed. So an age compounder could be referred to as a
C-AE. For an alloy of 2 God metals, additional notation may
be required, such as ′
to indicate the primary metal, or a
subscript to indicate which alloys, for example a Lerasium
Tanavastium alloy that makes a surge binder could be
expressed as L
′B, or the metal an Edgedancer's Shardblade
is made from could be BK4 or BKed. Such usage should
documented at time of use.
